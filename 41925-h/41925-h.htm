<h2>Foreword.</h2>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The aim will be to take the reader
along on the journey of the pioneer
woodsman, from comfortable hearthstone,
from family, friends, books,
magazines, and daily papers, and to disappear
with him from all evidences of civilization and
from all human companionship save, ordinarily,
that of one helper who not infrequently is an
Indian, and to live for weeks at a time in the
unbroken forest, seldom sleeping more than a
single night in one place.</p>

<p>The woodsman and his one companion
must carry cooking utensils, axes, raw provisions
of flour, meat, beans, coffee, sugar, rice,
pepper, and salt; maps, plats, books for field
notes; the simplest and lightest possible equipment
of surveying implements; and, lastly, tent
and blankets for shelter and covering at night
to protect them from storm and cold.</p>

<p>Incidents of the daily life of these two voluntary
reclusionists, as they occurred to the author,
and some of the results obtained, will be
told to the reader in the pages which are to
follow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Sowing the Germ That I
Knew Not.</b></big></div>

<div class="center"><br />"This superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise."</div>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">Early environment sometimes paints
colors on the canvas of one's later
life.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago in western New
York, there were thousands of acres of valuable
timber. The country was well watered,
and, on some of the streams, mills and factories
had sprung into existence. On one of these
were three sawmills of one upright saw each,
and all did custom sawing.</p>

<p>My father was a manufacturer, especially of
carriages, wagons, and sleighs. There were
no factories then engaged in making spokes,
felloes, whiffletrees, bent carriage poles, thills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
or shafts, and bent runners for cutters and
sleighs. These all had to be made at the shop
where the cutter, wagon, or carriage was being
built. Consequently the manufacturer was
obliged to provide himself with seasoned
planks and boards of the various kinds of wood
that entered into the construction of each vehicle.
Trips were made to the woods to examine
trees of birch, maple, oak, ash, beech,
hickory, rock elm, butternut, basswood, whitewood,
and sometimes hemlock and pine. The
timber desired having been selected, the trees
were converted into logs which in turn were
taken to the custom mill and sawed into such
dimensions required, as far as was possible at
that period to have done at these rather primitive
sawmills. Beyond this the resawing was
done at the shop.</p>

<p>Thus, almost unconsciously, at an early age,
by reason of the assistance rendered to my
father in selecting and securing this manufactured
lumber from the tree in the forest to the
sawed product of the mill, I became familiar
with the names and the textures of many kinds
of woods, the knowledge of which stood me in
good turn in later years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Preparations for the Wilds
of Wisconsin.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">In the city of Detroit, early in June,
1871, was gathered a group of four
veteran woodsmen of the lumbermen's
craft, and two raw recruits,
one, a student fresh from his father's law office
in Bay City, and the other, myself, whose frontier
experiences were yet to be gained.</p>

<p>A contract, by William S. Patrick of Bay
City, the principal of this group, had been made
with Henry W. Sage, of Brooklyn, New York,
to select and to secure by purchase from the
United States and from the state of Wisconsin,
valuable pine lands believed to be located in
the wilds of northern Wisconsin. Tents, blankets,
axes, extra clothing, cooking utensils,
compasses, and other surveying implements
were ordered, and soon the party was ready for
the start.</p>

<p>At that time no passable roads penetrated
the northern woods of Wisconsin from the
south. The country to be examined for available
pine lands at the commencement of our
work was tributary to the head waters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Flambeau River. To reach this point in the
forest it was thought best to enter the woods
from the south shore of Lake Superior. Also,
the United States land office controlling a part
of this territory, was located at Bayfield, Wisconsin,
and at that office must be selected such
township plats as would be needed in the examining
of lands in that portion of the Bayfield
Land District.</p>

<p>The quickest line of transit at that date was
by railroad to Chicago, and thence to St. Paul
over the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway,
crossing the Mississippi River at Prairie
du Chien, Wisconsin, to McGregor, Iowa, and
thence north to St. Paul. There was no other
railroad then completed from Chicago to St.
Paul. The only railroad from St. Paul to Lake
Superior was the St. Paul and Duluth. From
Duluth, passage was taken by steamer to Bayfield.
Township plats were here obtained from
the government land office. Provisions of
pork, flour, beans, coffee, rice, sugar, baking
powder, dried apples, pepper and salt, tobacco,
etc., for one month's living in the woods for
nine men, were bought and put into cloth sacks.
Our original number of six men was here augmented
by three half-breed Indians of the Bad
River Indian Reservation, who were hired as
packers and guides over a trail to be followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to the Flambeau Indian Reservation. A Lake
Superior fisherman was then engaged to take
the party and its outfit in his sailing boat from
Bayfield to the mouth of Montreal River, which
is the boundary between Wisconsin and Michigan.
The distance was about thirty-five miles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Entering the Wilds of
Wisconsin.</b></big></div>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">The party disembarked at a sand
beach, but the sailboat drew too
much water to permit a close landing.
Here it was that the two tenderfeet
got their first experience with Lake
Superior's cold water, since all were obliged
to climb or jump overboard into three feet of
the almost icy water, and to carry on heads and
shoulders portions of the luggage to the dry
land. Here was to begin the first night of my
camp life. Dry wood was sought, and camp
fires were kindled to be used, first, to dry the
wet clothing, and second, to cook the food for
the first out-of-door supper.</p>

<p>To avoid mosquitoes, orders were given to
prepare beds for the night on the sand beach
away from the friendly tall trees that stood
near by. One mattress served for the whole
party and consisted of as level a strip of the
sandy shore as could be selected. Promise of
fair weather rendered unnecessary the raising
of tents which were made to serve as so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
thickness to keep the body from contact with
the sand.</p>

<p>That night the stars shone brightly above
the sleepers' faces, the waters of Superior broke
gently along the beach, and the tall pines lent
their first lullaby to willingly listening ears.</p>

<div class="poem">
"The waves have a story to tell me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I lie on the lonely beach;</span><br />
Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wind has a lesson to teach;</span><br />
But the stars sing an anthem of glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I cannot put into speech.</span><br />
<br />
They sing of the Mighty Master,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the loom His fingers span,</span><br />
Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weft in the wondrous plan."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The next morning broke bright and clear,
and the sun sent a sheen upon the dimpled
waters of old Superior that gave us a touch of
regret at the parting of the ways; for the members,
one by one, after a well relished breakfast,
shouldered their packs and fell into single
file behind the Indian guide who led the way to
the trail through the woods, forty miles long,
to the Flambeau Reservation.</p>

<p>Two days and the morning of the third
brought the party, footsore in new boots and
eaten by mosquitoes, to the end of the trail.
Now, lakes must be crossed, and the Flambeau
River navigated for many days. In the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
village were many wigwams, occupied by the
usually large families of two or three generations
of bucks, squaws, children, from the eldest
down to the liquid-nosed papoose, and their
numerous dogs that never fail to announce the
approach of "kitchimokoman," the white man.</p>

<p>Some of the old men were building birch
canoes, and many birch crafts of different ages
and of previous service were to be seen in the
camp. From among them, enough were
bought to carry all of the men of the party and
their outfits. The last canoe bought was a
three-man canoe, which leaked and must be
"pitched" before it could be used.</p>

<p>At this point let it be explained that every
woodsman, trapper, pioneer, settler, or camper
who depends upon a birch canoe for navigation
should, and generally does, provide himself
with a quantity of commercial resin and a fireproof
dish in which to melt it. The resin is
then tempered by adding just enough grease
to prevent the mixture, when applied to the dry
surface of a leaky spot on the canoe, and cooled
in the water of the lake or river at the time of
using, from cracking by reason of too great
hardness. The surface must be dry or the
"pitch" will not adhere firmly to the leaky seam
or knot in the bark of the canoe. The drying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is quickly done by holding a live ember or firebrand
close to the surface of the wet bark.</p>

<p>Mr. Patrick had bought the canoes from different
owners and had paid for them all except
the leaky three-man canoe. It was the property
of a fat squaw of uncertain age. The price
agreed upon for this canoe was twenty dollars.
Mr. Patrick and the squaw were standing on
opposite sides of the canoe as Mr. Patrick took
from his pocket a twenty dollar bill to hand
her in payment. Just then he discovered that
the pan of pitch (resin), which had been previously
placed over the live coals, was on fire.
He placed the twenty dollar bill on the canoe in
front of the squaw, and quickly ran to extinguish
the fire in the burning pitch. When he
returned to the canoe, the bill had disappeared,
and the wise old squaw claimed to know nothing
of its whereabouts. A second twenty dollar
bill was produced and handed to the squaw,
when Mr. Patrick became the owner of a forty
dollar birch canoe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Surveying and Selecting Government
Timber Lands.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="100" height="105" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">Our party of land surveyors, or "land
lookers" as they were often called,
being thus supplied with water transports,
proceeded in their canoes a
short distance down the Flambeau River,
where the work of selecting government or
state lands timbered with pine trees was to
begin.</p>

<p>The questions have been so often asked,
"How do you know where you are when in the
dense forest away from all roads and trails, and
many miles from any human habitation?",
"How can you tell one tract of land from another
tract?", and "How can you tell what land
belongs to the United States and what to the
State?", that it seems desirable to try to make
these points clear to the reader.</p>

<span class="caption">The "V" shaped baker is a valuable part
of the cook's outfit. (Page <a href="#Page_36">36</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The Continental Congress, through its committee
appointed expressly for the work, inaugurated
the present system of survey of the public
lands in 1784. For the purposes of this explanation
it will be sufficient to recite that the
system consists of parallel lines six miles apart
running north and south, designated as "range
lines"; also of other parallel lines, six miles
apart running east and west, designated as
"township lines". Any six miles square bounded
by four of these lines constitutes a "township".
The territory within these two range
lines and two township lines is subdivided into
"sections", each one mile square, by running
five parallel lines north and south across the
township, each one mile from its nearest parallel
line, and, in like manner, by running five
other parallel lines east and west across the
township from the east range line to the west
range line, each line one mile from its nearest
parallel line. In this manner, the township is
subdivided into thirty-six sections each one
mile square. The four township corners are
marked by posts, squared at the upper end, and
marked on the four sides by the proper letters
and figures cut into the four flat faces by
"marking irons", each flat surface facing the
township for which it is marked.</p>

<p>In addition, one tree in each of the four township
corners is blazed (a smooth surface exposed
by chopping through the bark into the
wood) on the side of the tree facing the stake,
and the same letters and figures as are on the
nearest face of the stake are marked thereon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
These letters and figures give the number of
the township, range and section touching that
corner. On another blaze below the first, and
near the ground, are marked the letters "B T",
meaning "bearing tree".</p>

<p>The surveyor writes in his field book the kind
and diameter of tree, the distance and direction
of each bearing tree from the corner post, and
these notes of the surveyor are recorded in the
United States land office at Washington.</p>

<p>Even if the stake and three of the bearing
trees should be destroyed, so that but one tree
be left, with a copy of the notes, one could relocate
the township corner.</p>

<p>The section corners within the township are
marked in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Midway between adjacent section corners is
located a "quarter corner", on the line between
the two adjacent sections. This is marked by
a post blazed flat on opposite sides and marked
"&frac14; S". There are also two "witness trees" or
bearing trees marked "&frac14; S".</p>

<p>By running straight lines through a section,
east and west and north and south, connecting
the quarter corners, the section of six hundred
and forty acres may be divided into four quarter
sections of one hundred and sixty acres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
each. These may in turn be divided into four
similar shaped quarters of forty acres each
called "forties", which constitute the smallest
regular government subdivisions, except fractional
acreages caused by lakes and rivers
which may cut out part of what might otherwise
have been a forty. In such cases the government
surveyor "meanders" or measures the
winding courses, and the fractional forties thus
measured are marked with the number of acres
each contains. Each is called a "lot" and is
given a number. These lots are noted and
numbered on the surveyor's map or plat which
is later recorded.</p>

<p>The subdivision of the mile square section is
the work of the land looker, as the government
ceases its work when the exterior lines are run.</p>

<p>On the township plat which one buys at the
local United States land office, are designated
by some character, the lands belonging to the
United States, and, by a different character,
the lands owned by the State.</p>

<p>The country presented an unbroken forest
of the various kinds of trees and underbrush
indigenous to this northern climate. The deer,
bear, lynx, porcupine, and wolf were the rightful
and principal occupants. Crossing occasionally,
the trail of the first named, served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
only to remind us of our complete isolation
from the outside, busy world.</p>

<p>The provisions yet remaining were sufficient
to feed our party for less than three weeks. In
the meantime two of the Indians had gone
down the river in a canoe with Mr. Patrick to
the mouth of the Flambeau, to await the arrival
of fresh supplies which he was to send up to
that point from Eau Claire by team. The experienced
and skilled woodsmen had divided
the working force into small crews, which
began subdividing the sections within the
townships where there were government or
state lands, to ascertain whether there were
any forty acre tracts that contained enough
valuable pine to make the land profitable to
purchase at the land offices. Two thousand
acres were thus selected during the first cruise,
but, on our agent reaching the land office where
the lands had to be entered, only twelve hundred
acres were still vacant (unentered), other
land lookers having preceded our representative
and arrived first at the land office with
eight hundred acres of the same descriptions
as our own.</p>

<p>As there were many land lookers at this time
in the woods, all anxious to buy the good pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
lands from the government and the state, conflicts
like the above were not unusual.</p>

<p>Through a misunderstanding of orders, our
working party, now nearly out of everything
to eat, assembled at The Forks, a point forty-five
miles above the mouth of the Flambeau,
and waited for the Indians to bring up fresh
supplies. They did not come, and, after waiting
three days, while each man subsisted on
rations of three small baking powder biscuits
per day, all hands pushed down to the mouth
of the river where the Indians were awaiting
us with plenty of raw materials, some of which
were soon converted into cooked food of which
all partook most heartily.</p>

<p>Corrected plats, showing the unentered lands
of each township which we were directed to examine,
were sent to us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Gaining Experience&mdash;Getting
Wet.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.jpg" width="100" height="101" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Some field experience which I had acquired
in surveying when a sophomore
in college, assisted me greatly
in quickly learning how to subdivide
the sections, while my knowledge of timber
gained at an early age, when assisting my
father in choosing trees in the forest suitable
for his uses as a manufacturer, aided me greatly
in judging the quality and quantity of the
pine timber growing in the greater forests of
the Northwest.</p>

<p>Freshly equipped with provisions, and with
plats corrected up to date, we returned to the
deep woods. There we divided into parties of
only two&mdash;the land looker and his assistant.
The latter's duty was chiefly to help carry the
supplies of uncooked foods, blankets, tent, etc.,
to pitch tent at night, and, ordinarily, to do the
most of the cooking, though seldom all of it.
On some days much good vacant (unentered)
pine was found, and on other days none at all.
Several miles of woods were at times laboriously
passed through, without seeing any timber
worth entering (buying). Some portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
would consist of hardwood ridges of maple,
oak, elm; some of poplar, birch, basswood; others
of long stretches of tamarack and spruce
swamps, sections of which would be almost
without wooded growth, so marshy and wet
that the moss-covered bottom would scarcely
support our weight, encumbered as we always
were by pack sacks upon our backs, which
weighed when starting as much as sixty pounds
and sometimes more. Their weight diminished
daily as we cooked and ate from our store
which they contained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;">

<span class="caption">"The almost saucy, yet sociable
red squirrel". (Page <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>Windfalls&mdash;places where cyclones or hurricanes
had passed&mdash;were sometimes encountered.
The cyclones left the trees twisted and
broken, their trunks and branches pointing in
various directions; the hurricanes generally left
the trees tipped partly or entirely to the
ground, their roots turned up and their trunks
pointing quite uniformly in the same relative
direction. The getting through, over, under,
and <i>beyond</i> these places, which vary from a few
rods to a possible mile across, especially in winter
when the mantle of snow hides the pitfalls
and screens the rotten trunks and limbs from
view, tries the courage, patience, and endurance
of the woodsman. All of the time he must use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his compass and keep his true direction as well
as measure the distance, otherwise he would
not know where he was located. Without this
knowledge his work could not proceed.</p>

<p>Sometimes we would come to a natural
meadow grown up with alders, around the
borders of which stood much young poplar.
A stream of water flowed through the meadow,
and the beavers had discovered that it was eminently
fitted, if not designed, for their necessities.
Accordingly, they had selected an advantageous
spot where nature had kindly thrown
up a bank of earth on each side and drawn the
ends down comparatively near to the stream.
Small trees were near by, and these they had
cut down, and then cut into such lengths as
were right, in their judgment, for constructing
a water-tight dam across the narrow channel
between the two opposite banks of earth. The
flow of water being thus checked by the beaver
dam, the water set-back and overflowed the
meadow to its remotest confines, and even submerged
some of the trunks of the trees to perhaps
a depth of two feet. Out further in the
meadow and amongst the alders where had
flowed the natural stream, the water in the
pond was much deeper.</p>

<p>These ponds sometimes lay directly across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the line of our survey and inconvenienced us
greatly. We disliked to make "offsets" in our
lines and thus go around the dam, for the traveling
in such places was usually very slow and
tedious. The saving of time is always important
to the land hunter, since he must carry his
provisions, and wishes to accomplish all that
is possible before the last day's rations are
reached. It was not strange, then, if we first
tried the depth of the water in the pond by
wading and feeling our way. While we could
keep our pack sacks from becoming wet, we
continued to wade toward the opposite shore,
meantime remembering or keeping in sight
some object on the opposite shore, in the direct
course we must travel, which we had located
by means of our compass before entering the
water. Sometimes a retreat had to be made
by reason of too great depth of water. During
the summer months we did not mind simply
getting wet clothes by wading; but once in the
fall just before ice had formed, this chilly proposition
of wading across, was undertaken voluntarily,
and was only one of many uncomfortable
things that entered into the woodsman's
life.</p>

<p>Subjected thus to much inconvenience and
discomfort by those valuable little animals, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
could but admire their wisdom in choosing
places for their subaqueous homes. They feed
upon the bark of the alder, the poplar, the birch,
and of some other trees. These grew where
they constructed their dam and along the margin
of the pond of water thus formed. They
cut down these trees by gnawing entirely
around their trunks, then they cut off branches
and sections of the trunks of the trees, and
drew them into their houses under the ice.
Most trees cut by the beaver are of small diameter.
I once measured one beaver stump and
found it to be fourteen inches in diameter. I
still have in my possession a section of a white
cedar stump measuring seventeen inches in circumference
that had been gnawed off by beavers.
It is the only cedar tree I have ever known
to have been cut down by these wise little creatures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>A Birthday Supper.</b></big></div>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_f.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">Flambeau Farm was located on the
right bank of Chippewa River opposite
the mouth of Flambeau River.
There old man Butler kept a ranch
for the especial accommodation of lumbermen
and land hunters, who included nearly everyone
who came that way. It was at the end of
the wagon road leading from Chippewa Falls
and from other civilized places. Canoes, dugouts,
batteaus&mdash;all started from Butler's ranch
at Flambeau Farm for operations up the Flambeau
and its tributaries, or for either up or
down the Chippewa and its branches.</p>

<p>One rainy afternoon in October our party of
three started from Butler's ranch in a dugout
(a long, narrow canoe hewn out of a pine tree),
to pole down the Chippewa River to the mouth
of Jump River, a distance of about ten miles.
Notwithstanding the rain, everything went
smoothly for the first hour, when, without
warning, the bow of the canoe struck the edge
of a sand bar which caused the tottlish craft to
tip. The man in the stern jumped overboard to
save it from capsizing, expecting to strike his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
feet on the sand bar, but, in the meantime, the
frail craft had drifted away from the bar, and
we were floating over deep water which resulted
in our comrade's disappearing under the
surface. He soon rose hatless, and with a few
strokes swam to where he seized the stern of
the boat to which he was obliged to cling until
we could paddle to the shore, as any attempt
on his part to have climbed in would have resulted
in capsizing the boat, and would have
cost us all of our supplies.</p>

<p>We built a fire, and partly dried his wet garments,
after which we proceeded on our journey.
Entering the mouth of Jump River, we
flushed a small flock of wild geese, one of which
we shot and gathered into our dugout. A little
farther on, we were fortunate in bringing down
a fine mallard. By this time the snow had begun
to fall very rapidly, so that when we had
reached a suitable place to camp for the night,
the snow was fully three inches deep. Here,
near the bank of the river, we found an unoccupied
claim shanty built of logs, and containing
a very serviceable fireplace. We took possession
of it for the night, in consequence of which
it was unnecessary to pitch our tents. We began
the usual preparations for our evening meal
and for comfortable beds upon which to lie.
The latter were soon prepared by going outside
into a thicket of balsam fir trees, felling a
few with our axes, and breaking off the soft,
springy boughs which were stacked in bunches,
carried into camp, and spread in the convenient
bunks to constitute the mattresses over
which the blankets were later laid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"I found several families of Indians camping

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>While thus busy, an Indian hunter clad in a
buckskin suit came down the trail by the river
bank, bringing with him a saddle of venison.
Owing to the Indian's natural fondness for
pork, it was very easy to exchange a small piece
of the latter for some nice venison steaks. I
remember that because of the wet condition of
the snow, the Indian's buckskin pants had become
saturated with water, causing them to
elongate to such an extent that he was literally
walking on the bottom ends of them. His wigwam
was not far down the river, to which point
he soon repaired. Then the cook made a short
calculation of the menu he would serve us for
our supper after the very disagreeable experiences
of travel during the day. He decided to
broil the mallard and cook some venison steak.
Besides this, he boiled rice, some potatoes,
some dried peaches, and baked a few tins of
baking powder biscuits.</p>

<p>The land hunter's or surveyor's outfit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
cooking utensils invariably includes a nest of
tin pails or kettles of different sizes fitted one
within the other, and sufficient in number to
supply the needs of the camp; also a tin baker,
so constructed that when set up before an open
fire, it is a tilted "V" shaped trough of sufficient
length to place within it a good sized baking
tin, placed horizontally and supported midway
between the two sides of the "V" shaped baker,
so that the fire is reflected on the bright tin
equally above the baking pan and below it.</p>

<p>The snow had ceased falling, and, by building
a rousing camp fire outside of the claim
shanty, we were soon able to dry our clothing.
Having partaken of a sumptuous meal, we
"rolled in", contented and happy, for a night's
rest. To me, this 14th day of October was a
red letter day, and in memory ever since has
been because it was the birthday of my then
fiancée, who, not many years subsequent, became
and ever since has remained my faithful
and loving wife.</p>

<p>The second and final trip of that season in
open water was made several weeks later when
we again poled up the Chippewa River in a
dugout, taking with us our supplies for the
cruise in the forest.</p>

<p>The current in that part of the river was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
swift, not infrequently forming rapids, that we
were obliged always to use long poles made
from small spruce trees from which the bark
had been removed, and an iron spike fastened
at one end to aid in securing a hold when
pushed down among the rocks. The water was
so nearly at the freezing point that small flakes
of ice were floating, and the atmosphere was so
cold, that, as the pole was lifted from the water,
ice would form on it unless the pole at each
stroke was reversed, thus allowing the film of
ice formed on the pole to be thawed when immersed
in the slightly warmer water beneath.
The day spent in this manner was attended
with very great discomfort, and when night
came, each man found himself tired and hungry,
and glad that the day had come to an end.
We camped that night at a French-Canadian
logging camp. Our party was too fatigued to
pitch its own tents and prepare its own meal,
and gladly accepted the foreman's hospitality
at the rate of two dollars a day each, for some
of his fat pork, pea soup, and fairly good bread.</p>

<p>On the morning following, we found the ice
had so formed in the river that further journeying
in the dugout was impossible, so the latter
was pulled up on shore, covered with some
brush, and abandoned, at least for the winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and, as it proved in this instance, for always,
so far as it concerned our party. We finished
this cruise on foot, and returned about two
weeks later to Eau Claire.</p>

<p>There were not many men living on government
lands in that part of Wisconsin. Those
who had taken claims and were living on them
depended on their rifles for all of their fresh
meat. Some of them made a practice of placing
"set guns" pointing across deer trails. One
end of a strong cord was first fastened to a
tree, or to a stake driven into the ground some
distance from the deer trail. The cord was
then carried across the trail which was in the
snow, for a distance of one hundred feet or less.
Here, the gun was set firmly, pointing directly
in line with the cord or string. The barrel of
the gun was sighted at such an elevation as to
send the bullet, when fired, across the deer trail
at a height from the trail sufficient to penetrate
the body of the deer. The string was then
carried around some stationary object and fastened
to the trigger of the gun, the hammer of
which had been raised. The pressure of the
deer's body or legs against the string would be
pretty sure to discharge the gun, thus causing
the innocent and unsuspecting deer to shoot
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>While running a compass line one day, we
discovered, just ahead of us, a cord or string at
right angles to our line of travel. I stopped
immediately, while my companion, Tom Carney,
followed the cord to its end which he
found fastened to the trigger of a rifle. He
carefully cut the cord, raised the rifle to his
shoulder, and fired it into the air. He next
broke the gun over the roots of a tree. Further
examination showed that the cord was
stretched across a deer trail which we would
have reached in a minute more.</p>

<p>With the return of winter the Sage-Patrick
contract was about completed.</p>

The change of occupation and manner of living

the new contract for securing pine timber, was
undertaken. The ice in the rivers and lakes
had now become firm and safe for travel
thereon. Considerable snow had already
fallen, and the roads were heavy in consequence.</p>

<p>Our work, as planned, lay many miles up the
Chippewa River. In order to reach the desired
locality with sufficient supplies to enable us to
be gone a month or six weeks, it was necessary
to take them on a toboggan made expressly
for the uses of this proposed trip. Four men
were needed to push and pull the load. After a
week of hard labor, our party arrived at the
point where the work of surveying the lands
was to begin. A place to camp was chosen in
the thick woods not far from the river bank,
where water would be near by and convenient
for the use of the camp. A small, but strong
warehouse of logs was first constructed, in
which to store the supplies not necessary for
immediate use.</p>

<p>Having thus secured the supplies for future
use from the reach of any wild beasts roaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in the forests, we put enough of them into our
pack sacks to last for a ten days' absence from
our storehouse camp. We were about to start,
when Abbot, one of our axmen, in chopping a
stick of wood, had the misfortune to send the
sharp blade of the ax into his foot, deep to the
bone. The gash was an ugly one and at once
disabled him for further usefulness on this trip.
The man must be taken out of the woods where
his foot could receive proper care. How was
this to be accomplished? Two men alone could
possibly have hauled him on the toboggan.
The distance to the nearest habitation where a
team of horses could be obtained was seventy-five
miles. There was but one tent in the outfit
and not sufficient blankets to permit of dividing
our party of four men. It seemed, therefore,
that there was nothing possible to do but
for the whole party to retrace its steps to the
point where it had been obliged to leave the
team behind. The wound in Abbot's foot was
cleansed and some balsam having been gathered
from the fir trees, the same was laid on a
clean piece of white cotton cloth, which, used
as a bandage, was placed over the wound and
made secure. The wound having been thus
protected, Abbot was placed on the toboggan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and hauled to the ranch seventy-five miles
down the river.</p>

<p>Cruising in the woods is always expensive,
even when everything moves on smoothly and
without accident. The men's wages are the
highest paid for common labor, while the
wages of compassmen are much more. The
wages of the man of experience and knowledge
sufficient to conduct a survey, as well as to
judge correctly of the quality and quantity of
timber on each subdivision of land selected for
purchase, are from seven dollars to ten dollars
a day. He must determine the feasibility of
bringing the pine logs to water sufficient to
float them when cut, and the best and shortest
routes for the logging roads to reach the banks
of the rivers, or possibly the lakes where the
logs are unloaded; and, in these modern days
of building logging railroads, he must also locate
the lines of the railroads and determine
their grades. At the time above alluded to, no
logging railroads were in existence, and that
part of the expense did not have to be borne.
The trip proved to be a very expensive one, and
there had not been time before the accident to
choose one forty-acre tract of land for entry.</p>

<p>After arriving at Eau Claire where the land
office was located, and being delayed some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
days by other business, we found on going to
the land office, that many entries had just been
made of lands within the townships in which
we had planned to do our work, when the accident
to Abbot occurred. This fact necessitated
the choosing of other townships in which to go
to search for vacant lands on our next trip.</p>

<p>Having acquired from the land office the
necessary plats, and having secured a new
stock of provisions, we started again to penetrate
another part of the pine woods. This
trip occupied several weeks in which we were
more than ordinarily successful in finding desirable
lands, and we hastened to Eau Claire
in order that we might secure these by purchase
at the land office.</p>

<p>Rumors had been afloat for some time previous,
that there were irregularities in the conduct
of the office at Eau Claire. These rumors
had grown until action was taken by the general
land office at Washington, resulting in the
temporary closing of the Eau Claire land office
for the purpose, as reported, of examining
the books of that office.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 566px;">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="566" height="900" alt="" />
<span class="caption">S. D. Patrick</span>
</div>

<p>Many crews of men came out of the woods
in the days that followed, with minutes or
descriptions of lands which they desired to
enter, each in turn to find the land office closed
against them. In this dilemma, advice was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
taken as to what course to pursue. After having
taken counsel, I, as well as several others,
sent my minutes, together with the necessary
cash, to the general land office at Washington,
with application to have the same entered for
patents. Our minutes and our money, however,
were returned to us from Washington
with the information that the entry could not
be thus made, and that public notice would be
given of the future day when the land office
at Eau Claire would reopen for the transaction
of the government's business. All land
hunters of the Eau Claire district were therefore
obliged to suspend operations until the
time of the reopening of the land office. This
occurred on the first of May following.</p>

<p>I was there early and in line to enter the office
when its doors should be open at nine
o'clock in the morning, and reached the desk
simultaneously with the first few to arrive. All
were told that in due time, possibly later in
that day, they could call for their duplicate receipts
of such lands as they were able to secure.
There was present that morning, a man by the
name of Gilmore, from Washington, who, so
far as my knowledge goes, had never before
been seen at the Eau Claire land office. My
descriptions which I had applied for at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
land office on that morning had all been entered
by the man from Washington, resulting
in the loss of all of my work from January until
May. I was not alone in this unlooked for experience,
as I was informed by others that they
had shared the same fate.</p>

<p>Thus baffled, and believing that there was
no prospect of fair treatment in that land office
district, I determined to change my seat of operations
and to go into some other district. I
did so, going next onto the waters of the Wisconsin
River, the United States land office for
which district, was then located at Stevens
Point. Here I remained for many months,
operating with a good degree of success, and
found the land office most honorably and fairly
conducted for all.</p>

<p>The registrar of the land office was Horace
Alban, and the receiver was David Quaw. It
was always a pleasure to do business with these
two gentlemen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>A Few Experiences in the New
and More Prosperous Field.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">The life of the land hunter is at nearly
all times a strenuous one. He daily
experiences hardships such as working
his way up rivers with many
swift waters, and crossing lakes in birch-bark
canoes, in wind storms and in rain; fording
streams when he has no boat and when the
banks are too far apart to make a temporary
bridge by felling trees across the channel;
building rafts to cross rivers and lakes; climbing
through windfalls; crossing miles of swamp
where the bog bottom will scarcely support his
weight, and where, when night overtakes him
he must temporize a bed of poles on which to
lay his weary body to protect it from the wet
beneath him; and traveling sometimes all day
in an open and burnt country with his bed and
board upon his back, the sun's hot rays pressing
like a heavy weight upon his head, while
myriads of black flies swarm about him and
attack every exposed inch of his skin, even
penetrating through the hair of his head. These
are a few of his experiences, and, if these had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
not their offsets at certain times, his life would
become indeed unbearable. His health, however,
and his appetite are generally as good as
are enjoyed by any class of the human family.
Possessing these advantages gives him much
buoyancy of spirit, and, when a good piece of
country in the timber is encountered, he is
quick to forget the trials and the hardships of
the hour before, and to enjoy the improved
prospects.</p>

<p>There is doubt whether or not anything
finer enters into the joy of living than being
in the solitude of the great unbroken forest,
surrounded by magnificent, tall, straight, beautiful
pine trees, on a day when the sun is casting
shadows through their waving tops, listening
to the whisperings, formed almost into
words, of the needle-like fingers of their leafy
boughs, to the warbling of the songsters, and
to the chirping of the almost saucy, yet sociable
red squirrel who is sure to let one know
that he has invaded his dominion. Such days,
with such scenes and emotions, do come in the
life of the woodsman, the land hunter, who is
alone in the forest, except that if he be at all
sentimental, he approaches nearer to the Great
Creator than at almost any other time in his
life's experiences. Those who have read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
books of John Borroughs, John Muir, or Ernest
Thompson Seton, may appreciate somewhat
the joy that comes to the woodsman in his solitude,
if he be a lover of nature.</p>

<p>Those only, who have been through the experience,
can fully realize how anxious the
land looker is to secure the descriptions of valuable
lands that he has found when out on one
of his cruises, for he knows full well that it is
probable that he is not the only man who is in
the woods at that time, for the same objects as
his own. Sometimes, but rarely, two such men
may meet in the forest while at their work.
When this occurs, it is a courteous meeting,
but attended with much concealed embarrassment,
for each knows that the other has found
him out, and, if either is in possession of a valuable
lot of minutes which he hopes to secure
when he reaches the land office, he assumes
that the other is probably in possession of the
same descriptions, or, at least, a part of them.
It then becomes a question which one shall outwit
or outtravel the other, from that moment,
in a race to the land office where his minutes
must be entered, and to the victor belong the
spoils, which means in this instance, to the one
who is first there to apply for the entry of his
land descriptions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>While on one of these cruises on a tributary
of the Wisconsin River, with one man only for
help and companion, I had left my man,
Charlie, on the section line with the two pack
sacks, while I had gone into the interior of the
section, to survey some of its forties, and to
make an estimate of the feet of pine timber
standing on each forty. It was in midsummer
and in a beautiful piece of forest. Thrifty pine
trees were growing amongst the hard woods
of maple, birch, and rock elm. Having completed
my work in the interior of the section,
and having returned, as I believed, to a point
within a hundred yards of where Charlie was,
I gave the woodsman's call, then listened for
Charlie's answer, in order that I might go directly
to the point whence it should come. On
reaching Charlie, I picked up my pack and
started following the section line. We had
traveled less than a quarter of a mile on the
line, when I saw on the ground, a pigeon
stripped of its feathers. I picked up the bird
and found that its body was warm. Immediately
I knew that other land lookers were in
the same field and had undoubtedly been resting
on that section line at the time I had called
for Charlie, and they, hearing our voices, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hastily picked up their packs and started on
their way out.</p>

<p>There was much pine timber in this township
that yet belonged to the government and
to the state of Wisconsin. I, at this time, had
descriptions of more than four thousand acres
of these lands which I was anxious to buy.
My interest and anxiety, therefore, became intense
when I knew that my presence had been
discovered by the parties who had so unintentionally
left that bird on their trail. There
were no railroads in that part of the country
at that time, and Stevens Point, the location
of the government land office, lay more than
sixty-five miles south of where we then were.
Twenty-five miles of this distance was mostly
through the woods and must be traveled on
foot. It was then late in the afternoon and
neither party could make progress after dark.
The route through the woods led through a
swamp, and, upon reaching it, the tracks of
two men were plainly to be seen in the moss,
and in places in the wet ground. One man
wore heavy boots, with the soles well driven
with hobnails, which left their imprints in the
moist soil. Coming to a trail that led off into
a small settlement, we saw the tracks of one of
the two men following that trail. The tracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the man with the hobnails kept directly on
in the course leading to the nearest highway
that would take him to Wausau, a thriving
lumber town, forty miles distant from Stevens
Point. We reached this road at about three
o'clock in the afternoon of the next day. We
called at the first house approached, and asked
the woman if she could give us some bread
and milk, and, being answered in the affirmative,
we sat down for a rest, and inquired of
her if she had seen a woodsman pass. She
replied that she had, and that he had left there
within an hour of the time of our arrival. The
tracks of the boots with the hobnails could be
seen occasionally along the road, and, knowing
that the stage, the only public conveyance from
Wausau to Stevens Point, was not due to leave
Wausau for Stevens Point until four o'clock
the next morning, we had no further anxiety
about overtaking the woodsman who had left
there an hour in advance, since we reasoned
that he would probably take the stage at its
usual hour of leaving, the next day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="900" height="543" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"There were many waterfalls". (Page <a href="#Page_136">136</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>From that time on, the journey was leisurely
made, and we entered Wausau at a late hour,
when most of the laboring community had retired
for the night. Having gone to my accustomed
hotel, and changed my clothes, I next
walked over to a livery stable and hired a team
which I drove to Stevens Point during the
night, arriving there in time for breakfast. I
then went to the home of the land officer before
eating my breakfast, told him that I wished
to make some entries that morning, and asked
him at what hour the land office would be open;
and, seeing that my time agreed with that of
the land officer, told him that I would be there
promptly at nine o'clock, the legal hour for
opening the office. I made entry of the list
of lands belonging to the United States government,
and was told to return at eleven
o'clock to compare the duplicate receipts with
my application to enter the lands. While I was
thus engaged, the stage from Wausau arrived,
and a man came into the land office, wearing
a pair of boots with hobnails that looked very
much the size of the tracks that I had been
previously observing on my way out from the
woods to Wausau. He immediately asked for
the township plat which represented the lands
which I had been so anxious to secure. He
began reading the descriptions of the lands he
wished to enter, and, as he read them, I heard
with much interest, the same descriptions that
were in my own list, but there were some that
were different. Whenever a description was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
read that checked with one in my list, the land
officer replied that those lands were entered.
This occurred so many times that he soon inquired
when the lands had been entered. He
was told, "At nine o'clock this morning." In
his perplexity he had also read some of the
descriptions that belonged to the state of Wisconsin
and which had to be purchased at the
land office at Madison, the capital of the state.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked, "this is hard luck, but
I may secure my state land descriptions."</p>

<p>I always kept a balance of money with the
state treasurer at Madison, with which to pay
for lands whenever I should send a list by mail
or otherwise, when I did not care to go personally
with the descriptions.</p>

<p>The man having left the land office, I repaired
immediately to the telegraph office and
wired the descriptions of the lands I wished
to enter, to the chief clerk of the land office
at Madison, authorizing him to draw on my
account with the state treasurer, to pay for
the same. The train left Stevens Point that
afternoon for Madison, and both interested
parties were passengers. Arriving at the land
office, I found the lands telegraphed for, to
have been duly secured.</p>

<p>This instance is given to show by how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
slender a thread a matter of great interest
sometimes hangs. Had the pigeon not been
left on the section line, or had it not been discovered
by the competing land hunter, the
man with the hobnails in his boots would have
been the victor, and his would have been the
joy of having won that which he had striven
hard to attain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Tracing Gentlemen Timber
Thieves&mdash;Getting Wet&mdash;Fawn.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">I have said that the country tributary
to the waters of the Wisconsin
River constituted a good field for
the selection of valuable government
pine-timbered lands. It is equally true that it
was a country where the custom had grown
among lumbermen to enter a few forties of
government land, sufficient at least to make
a show of owning a tract of timber on which
to conduct a winter's operation of logging, and
then to cut the timber from adjacent or near
by forty-acre tracts of land yet belonging to
the government.</p>

<p>This method of trespassing upon the timber
not owned by the operator, but being the
property of the United States, was carried on
to a greater extent there than in any other
section of the state in which I was familiar
with the methods and practices of logging pine
timber. Many logging jobbers having formed
this habit of helping themselves to government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
timber, found it difficult, after the government
lands had been entered by private
purchase of others than themselves, to discontinue
their practice of taking timber that
was not their own. Reforms of such habits
do not come voluntarily nor easily, as a rule,
but generally under some sort of pressure.</p>

<p>In the years following my purchase of considerable
tracts of timber on these waters, I
found it necessary, annually, to make a trip
into the country where our timber lands were
situated, to ascertain whether or not there had
been near-by logging camps during the preceding
winter, and if so, to carefully run out
the lines around our own timber, to determine
whether or not trespass had been committed on
any of them. In many instances I found that
this was the fact. One spring I found a very
considerable number of the best pine trees cut
from the interior of forty acres of excellent
timber, so that the selling value of the whole
tract was injured far more than the full value
of the amount of timber that had been unlawfully
cut and hauled away. The trespass had
been committed by a man prominent in the
community and well-known among the lumbermen
of the Wisconsin River. The late Gust
Wilson of Wisconsin, a fine man, a lawyer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
much experience in lumber cases in that state,
and whose counsel was considered of a high
order, was retained to bring suit to recover
the value of the timber trespassed. Not only
that, but, annoyed at the boldness of the trespass,
I wished also to have him prosecuted
criminally for theft. Mr. Wilson said in reply
to the request, "Now, don't try that. All of
those fellows have had 'some of them hams,'
and you can't get a jury in all that country
that will bring you in a verdict of guilty, no
matter how great and strong your evidence
may be." There was nothing left to do under
Mr. Wilson's advice but to cool off, keep smiling,
and collect the best price for the stumpage
taken (not stolen), so as to be polite to the
gentlemanly wrongdoer.</p>

<p>One spring, accompanied by Mr. W. B.
Buckingham, cashier of one of the national
banks at Stevens Point, who also owned interests
in valuable pine timber lands adjacent
to, or near by those in which I owned interests,
I went into the countries of the Spirit and
Willow Rivers. The snow was melting and
the waters nearly filled the banks of the respective
streams. Wishing to cross the Spirit
River, we found a point where an island occupied
the near center of the stream, on which
was a little standing timber. A tree was felled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the top of which landed on the island. Having
crossed on the tree to the island, we felled another
tree which reached from the island to the
farther shore. It was not large in diameter,
and, under the weight of Mr. Buckingham,
who first proceeded, it swayed until he lost
his balance and fell into the water and was
obliged to swim to the opposite shore. I was
more fortunate in this instance, and stayed on
the tree until I reached the shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="900" height="546" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"We succeeded in crossing Burnt Side
Lake". (Page <a href="#Page_146">146</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>Swimming in ice water is never found comfortable,
and we hurried to a close at hand,
deserted logging camp, where, fortunately, we
found a large heating stove set up and ready
for use, and near by a fine pile of dry wood
for the stove, which had been left over from
the recent winter's operations of logging. In
a few minutes, a rousing fire was made, and,
after removing his garments and wringing
them as dry as possible, we hung them on lines
about the stove and quickly dried them and
made them ready for use. This was necessary,
as no change of clothing had been provided
for this intended short excursion into the
woods.</p>

<p>By the time our work was finished, the snow
had mostly melted away. The ice was all out
of the rivers, and we found ourselves one morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
on the banks of the Tomahawk River, wondering
how we were to cross it, if possible,
without the delay of constructing a raft sufficiently
large to carry us. The tote-road leading
to Merrill, which we wished to follow, was
on the opposite side of the Tomahawk from
where we approached it. We finally discovered
an old birch canoe hidden in the brush.
It was leaky and in very bad repair, so we set
ourselves to work gathering pitch from the
ends of a pile of freshly cut pine logs lying
on the bank of the river, banked there to be
pushed into the stream by the log drivers.
This we put into a dish with a little grease
and boiled until it was of the right consistency
to stick to the bark of the canoe. Patches of
cloth were laid over the riven places in the
bark, and pitched until the boat was made
waterproof&mdash;for temporary use at least.</p>

<p>With our small belongings, we got into the
canoe and started down the Tomahawk, intending
to stay in it as long as it would hold
together and take us on our journey, saving
us that much walking. Unfortunately, however,
for us, we soon came to a long strip of
rapids with which we were not familiar. Selecting
what we believed to be the best water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
we permitted the frail craft to float into the
rapids, and our fast journey down stream had
begun almost before we realized the fact. All
went well until nearly to the lower end of the
rapids, when the old canoe struck a sharp rock
slightly hidden under the water, and split in
two. Partly by swimming and partly by wading,
we reached the coveted shore, wetter and
wiser than when an hour before we had taken
an old canoe that was not our own, in which
to cross the stream, instead of spending considerably
more time to construct a raft on
which we could safely and with dry clothes,
have reached the opposite shore. The usual
woodsman's process of drying clothes was
again gone through with, since it was too cold,
at that season of the year, to travel all day in
our wet garments.</p>

<p>One early summer day while traveling
through a part of this same country, watered
by the Willow River, my companion and I
stopped in a majestic forest of towering white
pine trees, interspersed with the more spreading
hemlocks. It was nearing twelve o'clock,
and we were both hungry. While my companion
was collecting wood for a fire, I went
in search of water with which to make a pail
of hot coffee. Returning, I climbed over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
large hemlock tree that had fallen, probably,
from old age. There, nestled in the moss and
leaves, lay a spotted fawn. It made no effort
to get up and run from me, so I carefully approached
it and gently caressed it. Then I
lifted the handsome little creature, with its
great, trusting brown eyes, into my arms, and
carried it near to our camp fire. While my
helper was preparing dinner, I fondled this
beautiful infant of the forest that yet knew
no fear. I sweetened some water to which I
added just a sprinkle of meal, then fed it
from a spoon to this confiding baby animal.
After this, when I moved, the trusting little
creature followed me. When it came time for
us to resume our work I carried my little newly
found friend back to the spot where its mother
had probably left it and put it down in its
mossy, leafy bed, and, carefully climbing over
the log, left it to be better cared for than it

</div><p class="drop-cap">It was in the summer of 1872, while
I was at the United States land office
at Bayfield, Wisconsin, and was having
some township plats corrected
previous to going into the woods in that district
to hunt for pine timber, that John Buffalo,
chief of the Red Cliff band of Chippewa Indians,
a friend of the United States land
officers, made his quiet appearance at the land
office. I had asked where I could find a reliable,
trustworthy, and capable man to accompany
me on this cruise, planned to cover a
period of not less than two weeks. Captain
Wing, receiver of the land office, asked the
Indian chief, "John, wouldn't you like to earn
a little money by going into the woods to help
this man for a couple of weeks or more?" To
this the chief gave his consent with the usual
Indian "Ugh."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>During that day provisions were bought and
placed in individual cloth sacks. A strong
rowboat was secured and the journey begun.
Camp was made the first night on one of the
Apostle Islands in Lake Superior. The day
following, our destination was reached at the
mouth of the Cranberry River, where our boat
was carefully cached.</p>

<p>It rained for several days, in consequence
of which the underbrush was wet most of the
time, and in passing through it we became wet
to the skin. Before leaving home I had bought
for use on the trip what I believed to be a fine
pair of corduroy trousers. They looked well,
and the brush did not cling to them, a desirable
condition when traveling through thickets
often encountered in the woods. It rained the
first day that we were out. At night we pitched
our tent, prepared the evening meal, and at
an early hour retired. On retiring, it is usually
the custom for men camping, to remove their
outer garments and put them out of the way
at one side of the tent. Both were very tired
and soon fell asleep. I was awakened by a
very disagreeable odor within the tent and
walked out into the fresh air. Returning, I lay
down and remained thus until early daylight,
experiencing only a disturbed sleep during the
night. My feeling was that I had chosen an
undesirable bedfellow, and, as later developments
proved, it would have been reasonable
if the Indian chief had arrived at the same conclusion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="900" height="684" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"We started out with two birch
canoes". (Page <a href="#Page_148">148</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next day it again rained. After
the rain the sun came out bright and warm,
causing a rapid evaporation to take place on
our wet garments. It was under these circumstances
that the discovery was made that the
very disagreeable odor experienced during the
preceding night was again present, and was
emanating from the wet coloring matter that
had been used in the manufacture of the corduroy
trousers. The best possible defense&mdash;which
I felt it was necessary to make&mdash;was to
call attention to the fact that the strong odor
was coming forth from the corduroy cloth.
On reaching camp that evening, the new corduroys
were hung out on the limb of a tree where
they were last seen by our small camping party.</p>

<p>It is not customary for land hunters to work
less on Sunday than on other days, for the
principal reason that all of their provisions
must be carried with them on their backs, and,
that by resting on Sunday, the provisions
would disappear as rapidly, or more so, than
they would if work continued on that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
However, toward the end of our trip which
had been a very successful one in point of finding
desirable government timber lands to enter,
we decided that we would rest on the next day,
which was Sunday, just previous to our taking
our boat to make our return trip on Lake Superior
waters to the land office at Bayfield. As
a precaution, lest other land lookers should discover
our presence, our camping ground was
selected in the interior of the section. We had
eaten our dinner, and were enjoying a siesta
when we heard voices. Listening, we heard men
discussing the most direct line to take to reach
their boat, hidden somewhere on the shore of
the lake. Time sufficient was given to allow
them to get so far in our advance, that any
movement on our part would not be heard by
them. Soon, thereafter, we packed our tent
and all of our belongings and started for our
boat. We did not reach it until nine o'clock
the following morning. We were then forty-five
miles from Bayfield by water.</p>

<p>Soon after we had rowed out into the lake,
a northeasterly wind began to blow and did
not cease blowing during the entire day. The
sandstone bluffs around that portion of the
south shore of Lake Superior in many places
are nearly vertical and rise to very considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
heights, preventing any possible way of
escape from the water's edge for miles in extent.
It was with the greatest effort that we,
pulling with all our might, could keep the boat
out into the lake, so powerful was the wind,
and so increasingly great were the waves. Besides,
it was not possible to take a rest from
our labors for, the moment we ceased rowing,
our boat began rapidly drifting toward the
rocks on the south shore. Thus we labored
until near the middle of the afternoon, when
we got under cover of the first of the friendly
Apostle Islands. After resting awhile, before
dark we were able to reach the Red Cliff Indian
Agency, where we spent the night at the chief's
wigwam.</p>

<p>The next morning early, we resumed our
boat and rowed into Bayfield, arriving in time
to be present at the opening of the land office.
With much anxiety, I made application to
enter the vacant lands that had been selected
on this trip, fearing that the men whom we
had overheard talking in the woods two days
before, might have arrived in advance of me
and have secured at least a part of the same
descriptions. With great satisfaction, however,
I found the lands to be still vacant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
all of the minutes chosen while on this strenuous
cruise, I bought.</p>

<p>A little before noon of this same day, two
well-known land hunters from Chippewa Falls
came in, in their boat, off the lake, and, on
going to the land office, applied to enter nearly
all of the lands which I had secured a few hours
before.</p>

<p>The moralist might point with justification
to the fact that had we not rested on Sunday,
more than likely we should not have known
of the presence of any competitors in the field,
and should not, therefore, have worked so
many long hours in our boat on that windy
day, nor should we likely have reached the land
office in advance of the two men who arrived
there only a few hours later than ourselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Indian Traits&mdash;Dog Team.</b></big></div>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_c.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">Chief John Buffalo was a superior
Indian, always pleasant, companionable,
and willing to do a full
day's work. He seemed to prefer
the society of the white men, and therefore
spent much of his time with them. The Indian
grows to manhood schooled in superstition.
I recall that during the first long trip from the
mouth of Montreal River to the Flambeau
Reservation, and thence to the mouth of the
Flambeau River, on one evening the party
camped near by a natural meadow where the
grass had ripened and was dry. Our three
Indians went out with their knives, to gather
armfuls of the grass to spread in our tents to
soften our beds for the night. While thus
engaged, Antoine, one of the Indians, encountered
a blow-snake. This reptile, when defending
itself, emits an odor which is sickening,
but among white men is not considered
very dangerous. There was no question but
that Antoine was made sick for that evening
by the snake, which had not touched him but
had been very near to him. Ed and Frank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the other two Indians of the party, told us that
evening that it was too bad, for Antoine surely
would die within the year as a result of his
having gotten this odor from the blow-snake.
Two years subsequently, I landed at Bayfield
from a Lake Superior steamer, and one of the
first persons I met on the dock was Antoine,
who looked as hale and hearty and well as
he was before his experience with the blow-snake.
On congratulating him for his victory
over the dire calamity predicted, because of
his encounter two years previous with the
blow-snake, he was considerably embarrassed,
but made no explanation why he was yet alive.</p>

<p>During the first half of the seventies, there
was no railroad to the shores of Lake Superior
in Bayfield County. In January, 1876, it was
necessary for me to reach Bayfield on important
business. A very poor road had been
cut through the woods from Old Superior to
Bayfield, crossing the streams running north
into Lake Superior. United States mail was
carried on toboggans drawn by dogs, and conducted
by Indian runners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" width="900" height="530" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"The party subsisted well, until it arrived
at Ely". (Page <a href="#Page_150">150</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The snow was deep, and no trail was broken
on the morning that I arrived at Superior
hoping to secure some kind of conveyance to
take me through to Bayfield, but I found no
one who would volunteer to make the journey.
In this dilemma I sought the owners of dog
teams, and succeeded in purchasing two rather
small dogs that were young and full of life,
as well as well trained. These I hitched to
a toboggan and started on my journey of
ninety-five miles to Bayfield. The morning
was mostly gone when the start was made,
and that night was spent in a small cabin on
the Brule River. The cabin had been erected
for the use of the Indian mail carriers, and was
unoccupied. It contained a stove, however,
and wood was handy outside. The next morning
an early start was made, and our train
reached Bayfield, as I remember, about one
o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The return journey was made by the same
route. I had become acquainted with the
smart dog team, so that the return journey
was rather enjoyable than otherwise. I took
advantage of the down grades to get a little
rest by throwing myself flat upon the toboggan,
dismounting as soon as the up grades
were reached. I had become greatly attached
to the dogs, therefore I put them in the express
car, on my return from Duluth, and brought
them with me to Minneapolis. The thought
to do this was prompted by thinking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
little daughter at home, then two and one-half
years old, and of her baby brother, yet in arms.
A suitable sled was at once ordered made, with
a seat for little sister. To the sled, the dogs
were harnessed abreast, and the dogs and child
were never happier than when out on the
streets for exercise.</p>

<p>There were only two miles of street car track
in Minneapolis at that time, and that little
track was remote from the family home. The
city was then small. Passing teams on the
streets were infrequent, so that it was perfectly
safe for her to be out in her tiny conveyance,
accompanied always either by her father or
by her admiring uncle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Wolves&mdash;Log Riding.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">Many experiences of meeting or seeing
the more dangerous of the wild
animals have been related by men
whose occupation as woodsmen has
made it necessary at times to go for days, unaccompanied
into the woods, and miles distant
from any human habitation. Personal experience
leads me to believe that man is safe, nearly
always, except when such animals are suffering
from hunger.</p>

<p>Early one spring, while the snow was yet
deep in the woods, I was scaling some trespass
of timber that lay about three miles away from
my headquarters camp. In going to my work,
mornings, I passed along a trail near to which,
in the deep snow, was the carcass of a horse
which had belonged to the owner of a near-by
lumber camp. I noticed, one morning, that
it had been visited during the night by a pack
of wolves that had fed upon it and had gone
away, using the trail for a short distance and
then leaving it, their tracks disappearing into
the unbroken forest. The following morning,
having gotten an early start, on passing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
same place, I saw the wolves leaving their feeding
place and disappearing by the same route
as the tracks indicated on the preceding morning.
The animals seemed to be as anxious to
get out of my sight, as I was willing to have
them. Had it not been for their full stomachs,
their actions, likely, would have been different.</p>

<p>Returning, on a subsequent day just before
nightfall, tired from a long day's work, and,
probably, because of the late hour, thinking
of my near by neighbors, the wolves, I committed
an act that came near costing me my
life. The ice had gone out of the streams, and
the spring drive of logs was at its height. To
reach camp by the usual way, it was necessary
to follow up the stream one mile and cross on
a dam that had been constructed by the lumbermen
to hold back water to use in driving
logs out of this stream, which at this point was
about two hundred and fifty feet wide. The
gates were open, and the water was running
high within the banks of the stream. Seeing,
in the eddy close to the bank of the river, a
large log that would scale at least one thousand
feet board measure, I was seized with the idea
that I could, with the assistance of a pole, step
onto that log, push it out from shore, and guide
it across the stream to the opposite shore. It
was a log that had been skidded to the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the river and rolled in. On such logs, the
bark on the under side is always removed to
reduce the amount of friction produced by one
end of the log dragging, while it is being hauled
to the water's edge. The "log driver" belongs
to a class of men that has produced many
heroes, and some of their exploits are among
the most thrilling recorded among the exigencies
of a hazardous occupation. I never
was of that class, and was almost entirely without
experience in trying to ride logs in open
water. I had pushed the log out into the
stream some distance and all was lovely, as
every minute it was approaching nearer to
the opposite shore. Suddenly it entered the
current of the river which quickly revolved the
log under my feet, bringing the peeled side
uppermost, at which instance I was dropped
into the stream. The first thing I did on rising
to the surface, was to swim for my hat, which
had been pulled off as I sank under the water.
Having secured it, I commenced swimming
for the opposite shore. My clothing was heavy
and grew more so as it became soaked with
water, so that by the time I had attained the
further shore&mdash;in the meantime watching constantly
to see that no floating log bumped me,
thereby rendering me unconscious&mdash;I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
nearly exhausted.</p>

<span class="caption">"My three companions and I ... had gone to survey and

</div>

<p>During these years from 1871 to 1874, the
woods of Wisconsin were thoroughly traveled
over by land hunters, and nearly all of the
desirable timber was entered at the respective
land offices, so that there remained no further
field for exploit. A new field was therefore
looked for, and this I found in Minnesota.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Entering Minnesota, the
New Field.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">In the summer of 1874, I went to the
head waters of the Big Fork River
with a party of hardy frontiersmen,
in search of a section of country
which was as yet unsurveyed by the United
States government, and which should contain
a valuable body of pine timber. Having found
such a tract of land, we made arrangements
through the surveyor-general's office, then
located in St. Paul, to have the land surveyed.
The contract for the survey was let by the
United States government to Mr. Fendall G.
Winston of Minneapolis.</p>

<p>The logging operations on the Mississippi
River in Minnesota at this period extended
from a short distance above Princeton on the
Rum River, one of the tributaries of the Mississippi
River, to a little above Grand Rapids.
To reach Grand Rapids from Minneapolis, the
traveled route was by way of the St. Paul and
Duluth railroad to Northern Pacific Junction,
thence, over the Northern Pacific Railroad,
west to Aitkin. From this point the steamboat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Pokegama plied the Mississippi to Grand
Rapids, the head of navigation at that time.
For many years this steamboat was owned
and operated by Captain Houghton, almost
wholly in the interest of the lumber trade.
Later, Captain Fred W. Bonnes became its
owner. Subsequently, the old Pokegama
burned, when Captain Bonnes built a new boat,
using the machinery of the Pokegama, and
naming it Aitkin City. At a still later period
he built the larger steamer, Andy Gibson.</p>

<p>In those days, the lumber-jack was a very
interesting type of man. Men from Maine
and New Brunswick were numerous. Scotchmen,
Irish-Americans, and French-Canadians
constituted a considerable portion of all the
labor that went to the logging camps of Minnesota.
As early as the month of July, they
began their exodus from Minneapolis to the
woods for the purpose of building new camps,
cutting the wild grass that grew along the
natural meadows, and making it into hay for
the winter's use for oxen and horses. Some
of these men worked at the sawmills in summer,
but there was not employment for all at
this work, and many spent their time in idleness
and not infrequently in drunken carousal.
On leaving the city for the logging camps, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
were pretty sure to start out, each with one
or two bottles of whiskey stored away in his
tussock, which was ordinarily a two bushel,
seamless sack, with a piece of small rope tied
from one of its lower corners to the upper end
of the sack. In this were placed all of the
lumber-jack's belongings, except what were
carried in his pockets, including one or two
additional bottles of whiskey. Not all of the
lumber-jacks drank whiskey, but this was the
habit of very many of them. By the time the
train had arrived at Northern Pacific Junction,
where a change of cars was made, and where
the arrival of the Northern Pacific train from
Duluth, west bound, was awaited, many of our
lumber-jacks were well under the influence of
John Barleycorn. Disputes would frequently
arise while waiting for the train. These would
be settled by fist fights between the disputants,
their comrades standing about to see that each
man had fair play.</p>

<p>On one of our trips to the pine forests north
of Grand Rapids, we arrived at Aitkin on a
train loaded with this class of men, as well as
their bosses, and proprietors of the lumber
camps. Aitkin at that time was not much
more than a railroad station for the transfer
of the lumbermen and merchandise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
steamboat. A few men had preempted lands
from the government and had made their
homes where now is the city of Aitkin. The
late Warren Potter was one of them. He kept
a large store which was well stocked with
lumbermen's supplies, and which was the
rendezvous for the lumbermen. His preemption
claim was only a short distance in the
woods from his store. He had been East to
buy goods and had returned by train that day.
He found that his preemption claim had been
"jumped" by one, Nat Tibbetts, whom he found
occupying the Potter cabin. An altercation
took place between the two men, resulting in
Tibbetts blacking Potter's eye. The only representative
of the law was a justice of the peace,
a man whose name was Williams. Before him,
Potter swore out a warrant for the arrest of
Tibbetts, charging Tibbetts with assault with
intent to do bodily harm. Potter asked me to
act as his attorney to prosecute his case. This
honor was politely declined, and I assured him
that he would find a better man for the occasion
in the person of S. S. Brown, the well-known
log jobber, who was in town.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown having consented to act in the
interest of Mr. Potter, and Mr. Tibbetts having
secured some other layman to defend his case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all parties repaired, as I remember, to an unoccupied
building which was temporarily used
as a court of justice. As almost the entire
community that evening was a floating population
of lumbermen of various sorts, waiting
for an opportunity to start up the river on the
steamboat the following day, it will readily
be seen by the reader that this occasion was
one of unusual interest and bade fair to furnish
an interesting entertainment for a part of the
long evening.</p>

<p>Tibbetts demanded a jury trial. The jury
was chosen, and the prosecution opened the
case by putting on the stand, a witness who
had seen the encounter, and who proved to be
a good witness for Mr. Potter. The case proceeded
until the evidence was nearly all presented.
At this juncture, in the back end of
the improvised court room, a tall lumber-jack
who was leaning against the wall, and who was
considerably the worse for whiskey, cried out,
"Your honor! your honor! I object to these
proceedings." Everything was still for a moment,
and all eyes turned toward the half drunk
lumber-jack. Justice Williams attempted to
proceed, when the lumber-jack repeated his
calls and his demands to be heard. Every one
present knew that any attempt on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the constable to quiet this man would have resulted
in starting a general fight, where there
were so many who were under the influence of
liquor. Some one, therefore, said to the justice,
"Your honor, you had better hear the man's
objections." Justice Williams then said, "You
may state your objections, sir." The lumber-jack
replied, "I object, your honor, because that
jury has not been sworn." This was true. The
jury was then sworn, and the trial of the case
was begun anew. The witnesses having again
given their evidence under oath, the case was
soon argued by the improvised lawyers. The
justice gave a short charge to the jury, and,
without leaving their seats, and while the spectators
waited, they notified the justice that
they had agreed upon a verdict of guilty. The
justice fined Mr. Tibbetts one dollar, and this
frontier court of justice adjourned.</p>

<p>The question of the ownership of the claim
was not before the court. My recollection,
however, concerning it, is that Mr. Potter ever
after had peaceful possession of the land.</p>

<p>The ride up the Mississippi to Grand Rapids
on the steamer Pokegama, which tied up each
night, occupied two days and a half. The distance
was one hundred and ninety-five miles.
The steamer was crowded, and men slept
everywhere on the deck, on their blankets or
without them, as best fitted their condition.
Whiskey and cards were plentiful. The table
was well supplied with good things to eat.
Grand Rapids at that time consisted of a
steamboat landing, a warehouse, and a ranch
or stopping place kept by Low Seavey, whose
wife was a half-breed. These were on the left
bank of the river just below the falls or rapids.
On the opposite side of the river was a small
store, a new enterprise, and owned by a man
whose name was Knox.</p>

<p>I met Mr. Winston and his assistant surveyors
at Grand Rapids about the middle of
August. There were no roads leading into
the country that we were to survey, and, as
our work would extend nearly through the
winter, it was necessary to get our supplies
in sufficient quantity to last for our entire campaign,
and take them near to our work. This
was accomplished by taking them in canoes
and boats of various sorts. Our first water
route took us up the Mississippi River, into
Lake Winnibigoshish, and from that lake on
its northeasterly shore, we went into Cut-foot
Sioux, or Keeskeesdaypon Lake. From this
point we were obliged to make a four mile
portage into the Big Fork River, crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Winnibigoshish Indian Reservation. From an
Indian encampment on this reservation, at the
southwest shore of Bow String Lake, we hired
some Indians to help pack our supplies across
the four mile portage. Before half of our supplies
had been carried across the portage, the
Indian chief sent word to us by one of his
braves, that he wished to see us in council and
forbade our moving any more of our supplies
until we had counseled with him. Although
the surveyors were the agents of the United
States government, for the sake of harmony,
it was thought best to ascertain at once what
was uppermost in the chief's mind.</p>

<p>That evening, a conference was held in the
wigwam of the chief. First, the chief filled full
of tobacco, a large, very long stemmed pipe,
and, having lighted it with a live coal from
the fire, took the first whiff of smoke; then
immediately passed it to the nearest one of our
delegates to his right, and thus the pipe went
round, until it came back to the chief, before
anything had been said. The chief then began
a long recital, telling us that the great father
would protect them in their rights to the exclusive
use of these lands. The chief said that
he was averse neither to the white man using
the trail of his people nor to his using the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
waters of the rivers or lakes within the boundaries
of the reservation, but, if he did so, he
must pay tribute. In answer to his speech, the
chief surveyor of our party, Fendall G. Winston,
replied that he and his men had been
sent to survey the lands that belonged to
the great father; and, that in order to reach
those lands, it was necessary that his people
should cross the reservation which the
great father had granted to his tribe; nevertheless,
that they felt friendly to the Indians; that
if they were treated kindly by himself and his
tribesmen, they should have an opportunity to
give them considerable work for many days,
while they were getting their supplies across
his country to that of the great father, where
they were going to work during the fall and
winter; and that they would also make him
a present of a sack of flour, some pork, some
tea, and some tobacco. He was told, too, that
this was not necessary for the great father's
men to do, but that they were willing to do
it, provided that this should end all claims of
every nature of the chief, against any and all
of the great father's white men, whom he had
sent into that country to do his work. This
having been sealed with the chief's emphatic
"Ugh," he again lighted the pipe, took the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
whiff of smoke, and passed it around. Each,
in token of friendship, did as the chief had
already done. This ended the conference, and
we were not again questioned as to our rights
to pass over this long portage trail, which we
continued to use until our supplies were all in.</p>

<p>As nearly as I can now recall, our force was
made up of the following men: Fendall G.
Winston, in whose name the contract for the
survey was issued; Philip B. Winston, brother
of Fendall G. Winston; Hdye, a young engineer
from the University of Minnesota;
Brown, civil engineer from Boston; Coe, from
the Troy Polytechnic School of Engineering;
Charlie, a half-breed Indian; Franklin, the
cook; Jim Flemming, Frank Hoyt, Charlie
Berg, Tom Jenkins, George Fenimore, Tom
Laughlin, Joe Lyon, Will Brackett, Miller, and
myself.</p>

<p>Flemming, poor fellow, was suffering with
dysentery when he started on the trip. On
reaching Grand Rapids, he was no better, and
it was thought best not to take him along to
the frontier, so he was allowed to go home.
Miller was not of a peace loving disposition,
and, having shown this characteristic early,
was also allowed to leave the party. It was
best that all weaklings and quarrelsome ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
should be left behind, because it was easily
foreseen that when winter closed in upon the
band of frontiersmen, it would be difficult to
reach the outer world, and it would be unpleasant
to have any in the party that were
not, in some sense, companionable.</p>

<p>Considerable time was consumed in getting
all of our supplies to headquarters camp, which
consisted of a log cabin. The first misfortune
that befell any one of our party came to Frank
Hoyt, who one day cut an ugly gash in the
calf of his leg with a glancing blow of the ax.
The cut required stitching, but there was no
surgeon in the party. Will Brackett, the youngest
of the party, a brother of George A.
Brackett, and a student from the university,
volunteered to sew up the wound. This he did
with an ordinary needle and a piece of white
thread. The patient submitted with fortitude
creditable to an Indian. Some plastic salve
was put on a cloth and placed over the wound,
which resulted in its healing too rapidly. Proud
flesh appeared, and then the wisdom of the
party was called into requisition, to learn what
thing or things available could be applied to
destroy it. Goose quill scrapings were suggested,
there being a few quills in the possession
of the party. Brackett, however, suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the use of some of the cook's baking
powder, because, he argued, there was sufficient
alum in it to remove the proud flesh
from the wound. "Dr." Brackett was considered
authority, and his prescription proved effectual.
Hoyt was left to guard the provision
camp against possible visits from the Indians,
or from bears, which sometimes were known
to break in and to carry away provisions.</p>

<p>It is never necessary for surveyors whose
work is in the timber, nor for timber hunters,
to carry tent poles, because these are easily
chosen from among the small trees; yet nine
of our party one time in October, with the rain
falling fast and cold, found themselves, at the
end of the four mile Cut-foot Sioux Portage,
on a point of land where there were no poles.
All of the timber of every description had been
cut down and used by the Indians. The Indian
chief and several of his family relations lived
on this point. They had built the house of
poles and cedar bark, in the shape of a
rectangle. Its dimensions on the ground were
about twelve by twenty feet; its walls rose to
a height of about five feet; and it was covered
by a hip roof.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="900" height="525" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"Our camp was established on the shores of
Kekekabic Lake". (Page <a href="#Page_151">151</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>Our party must either obtain shelter under
this roof or must get into the canoes and
paddle nearly two miles to find a place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it could pitch its tents. At this juncture
the hospitality of the Indians was demonstrated.
The chief sent out word that we should
come into his dwelling and remain for the
night. The proffer was gladly accepted. When
we had all assembled, we found within, the
chief and his squaw, his daughter and her husband,
the hunter, his squaw and two daughters,
besides our party of nine, making a total of
seventeen human beings within this small enclosure.
A small fire occupied a place on the
ground at the center of the structure, an ample
opening in the roof having been left for the
escape of the smoke and live sparks. Indians
can always teach their white brothers a lesson
of economy in the use of fuel. They build
only a small fire, around which, when inside
their wigwams, they all gather with their
usually naked feet to the fire. It is a physiological
fact that when one's extremities are
warm, one's bodily sufferings from cold are at
their minimum. Our party boiled some rice
and made a pail of coffee, without causing any
especial inconvenience to our hosts, and, after
having satisfied hunger and thirst, the usual
camp fire smoke of pipes was indulged in, before
planning for any sleep. Our party had
been assigned a portion of the space around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the open fire, and our blankets were brought
in and spread upon the mats that lay upon
the earth floor.</p>

<p>The additional presence of nine Indian dogs
has not previously been mentioned. Before
morning, however, they were found to be live
factors, and should be counted as part of the
dwellers within the walls of this single room.
They seemed to be nocturnal in habit, and to
take an especial delight in crossing and recrossing
our feet, or in trying to find especially cozy
places between our feet and near to the fire,
where they might curl down for their own
especial comfort. It was not for us, however,
to complain, inasmuch as the hospitality that
had been extended was sincere; and it was to
be remembered by us that it was in no way
any advantage to the Indians to have taken
us in for the night. Therefore, we were truly
thankful that our copper colored friends had
once more demonstrated their feelings of humanity
toward their white brothers. They
had been subjected to more or less inconvenience
by our presence, but in no way did they
make this fact manifest by their actions or by
their words. The rain continued at intervals
during the entire night, and it was with a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of real gratitude, as we lay upon the
ground, and listened to it, that we thought of
the kindly treatment we were receiving from
these aborigines. In the morning we offered
to pay them money for our accommodations,
but this they declined. They did, however,
accept some meat and some flour.</p>

<p>While we were crossing the lake, one day,
in canoes loaded with supplies of various descriptions,
an amusing, yet rather expensive,
incident happened in connection with one of
the canoes. Its occupants were George Fenimore,
a Mainite Yankee, and Joe Lyon, a
French-Canadian. Both were good canoemen,
but only Fenimore knew how to swim.
They had become grouchy over some subject
while crossing the lake, and, as they neared
the opposite shore from which they had started,
in some manner which I have never understood,
the canoe was overturned. Little of its
contents was permanently lost, except one box
of new axes. The water was about eight feet
deep under them. Each man grasped an end
of the overturned canoe, and clung to it. Then
an argument began between the two disgruntled
men, about getting to shore. Lyon
wanted Fenimore to let go of the canoe and
swim ashore; but this, the latter refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
do. Finally, after considerable loss of time,
Joe Lyon, who was nearest to shore, turned his
body about, with his face toward the shore,
and, letting go of the canoe, went to the bottom
of the lake and floundered to gain the
shore. He had only to go a short distance
before the water became sufficiently shallow
for his head to appear, but he was winded, and
thoroughly mad. I have always believed that
Fenimore purposely overturned the canoe, but
if so, he never admitted the fact.</p>

<p>The pine timber lying east of Bow String
Lake, and included in the survey of 1874 and
1875, was all tributary to waters running north,
into the Big Fork River, which empties into
the Rainy River. Levels were run across from
Bow String Lake into Cut-foot Sioux River,
and considerable fall was found. The distance,
nearly all the way, was over a marsh. It was
shown that a dam could easily be thrown across
from bank to bank of the river at the outlet
of Bow String Lake, and by thus slightly raising
the water in the lake, plus a little work of
cleaning out portions of the distance across
the marsh, from Bow String Lake to Cut-foot
Sioux, the timber could be driven across and
into the waters of the Mississippi River. All
of this engineering was before the advent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
logging railroads. However, before the timber
was needed for the Minneapolis market, many
logging railroads had been built in various
localities in the northern woods, and their
practical utility had been demonstrated. When
the time came for cutting this timber, a logging
railroad was constructed to reach it; and over
its tracks, the timber was brought out, thus
obviating the necessity of impounding the
waters of Bow String Lake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>An Evening Guest&mdash;Not
Mother's Bread.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">I have previously mentioned the presence
of nine dogs at an Indian camp,
where members of our party spent
a night. One of these animals is deserving
of special mention, for the reason that
he was a stranger among a strange people, and
he was evidently so against his own choice.
He had at one time been a fine, large mastiff.
His history was never learned in full, but from
an account of the animal, gained by questioning
the Indians who had him in captivity, it
was learned that the dog had belonged at some
lumber camp. It often happens that the midday
meal for most of the men in a large logging
crew must be taken out on a sled, usually
drawn by a single horse, for a distance of not
infrequently three or four miles from the cook's
camp. This is the work of the cookee; and,
at the logging camp where the mastiff had belonged,
the animal had been used instead of
a horse, to pull the load of the midday meal
out to the men at work. In what manner he
had been left behind when the camp broke in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the spring, was not learned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="550" height="900" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"The memorable fire ... which swept
Hinckley". (Page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>He was about the size of two or three ordinary
Indian dogs, and was correspondingly
less sprightly in his movements. He was very
poor when members of our party first saw him.
Indian dogs never get enough to eat, and this
poor fellow with his large frame, had the appearance
of not receiving any more for his
portion of food than an average Indian dog,
if as much. He looked as though he were
hungry, and probably was, every day. The
particular action that impressed itself upon
every member of our party, was this animal's
almost human desire for sympathy that he
sought from this party of white men, when
he and they first met at the Indian camp. He
wagged his tail and passed from one member
of our party to another, with an expression of
unusual joy. He rubbed against us and almost
begged to be caressed. Every man of our
party pitied him and would gladly have sent
him out to the white man's country, had it been
at all practicable to have done so.</p>

<p>Later in the fall, I was camped for a single
night, some three hundred yards distant from
the Indian encampment, on the shore of a lake
that I must cross the following morning.
While I was preparing my evening meal, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mastiff made his appearance, wagging his tail,
and wishing by his actions to say, "I am glad
to see you, and have come to call on you."
It is the custom of the land hunter, as well
as other frontiersmen, when paddling his canoe
across a lake, to throw out a trolling line; and
not infrequently, in those northern lakes, a
catch of several fish may thus be made. On
that day, such had been my experience, and
I had in my possession, several fine wall-eyed
pike that I intended to take through to the
main camp, which I should reach on the following
day. I also had a small bag of corn meal,
which I sometimes used as a substitute for
oatmeal, in cooking a porridge for my own
use. While preparing my supper, I took the
largest kettle, filled it with water, and placed
it over the fire. I then cut into small pieces,
a number of the fish, and put them in the kettle
to boil. Later I added some corn meal and
cooked all together. When it was sufficiently
done, I removed one-half of the pail's contents
and spread it out on a large piece of birch bark
to cool. When it had cooled sufficiently, I
invited my welcome guest, the mastiff, to partake
of the food. Every mouthful eaten was
accompanied by a friendly wag of the animal's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
tail. The portion remaining in the pail I hung
on a limb, high enough up in the tree to be
out of reach. The dog remained about the
camp, and when I lay down in my blankets
for the night, he curled down at my feet and
there remained until morning.</p>

<p>While I was preparing my own breakfast,
I took the pail from the tree and placed it over
a small fire, that I might give my guest a warm
breakfast. I spread out on the same birch
bark, all that remained in the pail, and it was
eaten to the last morsel by the grateful animal.</p>

<p>Having placed all my belongings in my birch
canoe, I pushed out into the lake without the
dog, who tried hard to follow, and, as the
canoe went farther from the shore, the homesick
animal commenced to whine at his loss
of companionship. By every means possible
to a dumb beast, this dog had expressed his
dislike for his enforced environment and his
longing to be back with the white man. I
could not help but believe that the feelings
expressed by this dog were akin to those of
many a captive man or woman who had fallen
into the hands of the aborigines.</p>

<p>Our frail birch canoes had been abandoned
as cold weather approached, and we had settled
down to the work of surveying. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
however, we came to lakes that must be
crossed. This was accomplished by cutting
some logs, and making rafts by tying them
together with withes. Sometimes these rafts
were found insufficiently buoyant to float
above water all who got onto them, so that
when they were pushed along there were no
visible signs of anything that the men were
standing on. When on a raft, Hyde was always
afraid of falling off, and would invariably
sit down upon it. This subjected him to
greater discomfort than other members, but
as it was of his own choosing, no one raised
any objection.</p>

<p>One day, several of the party had gone to
the supply camp to bring back some provisions
which the cook had asked for. Returning, not
by any trail, but directly through the unbroken
forest, we found ourselves in a wet tamarack
and spruce swamp; and, although we believed
we were not far from the camp where we had
left the cook in the morning, we were not certain
of its exact location. Mr. F. G. Winston
said he thought he could reach it in a very
short time, and suggested that we remain
where we were. He started in what he believed
to be the direction of the camp, saying
that he would return in a little while. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
waited until the shades of night began to fall;
and yet he did not come. Preparations were
then made to stay in the swamp all night. The
ground was wet all around us, nor could we
see far enough to discern any dry land. We
commenced cutting down the smaller trees
that were like poles, and with these poles, constructed
a platform of sufficient dimensions to
afford room for four men to lie down. Then
another foundation of wet logs was made, on
which a fire was kindled, and by the fire, we
baked our bread and fried some bacon, which
constituted our evening meal. A sack of flour
was opened, a small place within it hollowed
out, a little water poured in, and the flour mixed
with the water until a dough was formed.
Each man was told to provide himself with a
chip large enough on which to lay the piece
of dough, which was rolled out by hand, made
flat, and then, having been placed in a nearly
upright position against the chip in front of the
fire, was baked on one side; then turned over
and baked on the other. In the meantime, each
man was told to provide himself with a forked
stick, which he should cut with his jackknife,
and on it to place his piece of bacon and cook
it in front of the fire; thus each man became
his own cook and prepared his own meal. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was no baking powder or other ingredient to
leaven the loaf&mdash;not even a pinch of salt to
flavor it. But the owner of each piece of dough
was hungry, and, by eating it immediately
after it was baked and before it got cold, it was
much better than going without any supper.
The following morning, the party resumed its
journey, and met Mr. Winston coming out to
find it. He had found the cook's camp, but at
so late an hour that it was not possible for him
to return that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>A Hurried Round Trip to Minneapolis&mdash;Many
Instances.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="100" height="104" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">After leaving Grand Rapids about
the middle of August, we saw very
few white men for many months following.
In October, on our survey,
local attraction was so strong on part of our
work, that it was necessary to use a solar compass.
This emergency had not been anticipated;
it, therefore, became necessary to go to
Minneapolis to secure that special instrument.
Philip B. Winston, afterwards mayor of Minneapolis,
and I started in a birch canoe, and in
it, made the whole distance from our camp on
Bow String Lake to Aitkin, Minnesota, on the
Mississippi, the nearest railroad station. We
were in Minneapolis but two days, when we
returned, catching the steamer at Aitkin, and
going up the Mississippi to Grand Rapids, the
head of navigation for steamboats.</p>

<p>Captain John Martin of Minneapolis, the
well-known lumberman and banker, wished to
return with us for his final fishing trip in open
water, for that season. He fished successfully
for a number of days, and, at the end of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
day, personally prepared and cooked as fine a
fish chowder as anyone would ever wish to eat.
On the day of his departure, I took the Captain
in my canoe, and landed him on the four-mile
portage with an Indian escort who was to take
him to Grand Rapids, whence he would return
by steamer to Aitkin, a station on the line of
the Northern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>I was left alone in my canoe and must return
to camp, crossing the open water of Bow String
Lake. On my arrival at the main lake, the
wind had increased its velocity, and the whitecaps
were breaking. I hired an Indian, known
as "the hunter," to help me paddle across the
lake and up a rapid on a river flowing into Bow
String, up and over which it was not possible
for one man to push his canoe alone.</p>

<p>The annual payment to the Indians by the
United States government was to occur a few
days subsequently, at Leach Lake, and the Indians
were busy getting ready to leave, to attend
the payment. The hunter's people were
to start that day, and he seemed to realize when
half way across the lake, that, owing to our
slow progress, because of the heavy sea, he
would be late in returning to his people at
camp. He said so, and wished to turn back,
but I told him that he must take me above the
rapid, which was my principal object in hiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
him. After sitting stoically in the bow of the
canoe for a few moments, he suddenly turned
about, and, drawing his long knife, said in
Chippewa, that he must go back. I drew my
revolver and told him to get down in the canoe
and paddle, and that if he did not, he would get
shot. There was no further threat by the Indian,
and we made as rapid progress as possible
over the rapid, landing my canoe&mdash;his own
having been trailed to the foot of the rapid.
Both stepped ashore. Then he said in Chippewa,
"Me bad Chippewa; white man all
right"; and bidding me good-by, hurried off to
his canoe at the foot of the rapid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"The fire ... destroyed millions of dollars worth of
standing pine timber". (Page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>Once more, during the fall of 1874, I had to
reckon with this wily Indian, the hunter, as
will soon appear in this narrative.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most convenient pack strap used
by the woodsman when on an all day's tramp,
is one that is commonly known as the Indian
pack strap. It consists of a strap of leather
about three inches wide and about three feet
long, from each end of which, a tapering piece
of leather, either sewed or buckled to it, extends
finally to a narrow point no wider than
a whip-lash. Each of these added narrow
strips is from five to six feet in length, so that
the whole strap is about fourteen feet long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when straightened out. A blanket or a tent is
folded into shape, about four feet by six feet.
This is laid on the ground, and the strap is
folded double with a spread at the wide part,
of about three feet, which is the length of the
wide strap. The narrow ends are then drawn
straight back over the blanket, across its narrow
dimension, leaving the wide strap, which
in use becomes the head strap, at the outer
edge of the blanket. Then the blanket is folded
from each end over the narrow straps, the two
ends of which project out and beyond the
blanket at the opposite side from the head
strap. The articles to be placed within the
blanket, which generally consist of small sacks
of beans, flour, pork, sugar, coffee, and wearing
apparel, and blankets, are then carefully
stacked upon the blanket, within the spread
of the two narrow lines of the pack strap.
When this is done, the blanket is folded over,
and the two outer edges are brought as near to
the center of the pile of things to be carried
within it, as is possible. Then the two tapering
ends of the pack strap are brought up and
over, to meet the opposite ends of the narrow
straps, which, as has been explained, are either
sewed to, or buckled onto the wide head strap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Drawing these ends firmly together puckers
the outer edge of the blanket on either side,
and draws the blanket completely over the contents
piled in the center, and makes, ordinarily,
nearly a round bundle. This load, or pack, the
man then throws over his shoulder, onto his
back, and brings the wide strap across his forehead,
or across his breast, or across the top of
his head, when he is ready to begin his journey.
Before he has traveled long with this load,
which weighs ordinarily from fifty to one hundred
pounds, according to the ability of the
man to bear the burden, he will be found shifting
that wide strap to any one of the three positions
named, and will have used all of those
positions many times before the party as a
whole, stops for a moment's rest.</p>

<p>I had taken with me, on going north on this
long campaign, an extra fine red leather pack
strap that I had had made to order at a Minneapolis
harness shop. I had kept it coiled up,
and carefully stored in my belongings, waiting
for an emergency when the more common
straps would no longer be of service. A number
of times the Indians had seen this strap
and had admired it, and, as it later proved, not
always without envy.</p>

<p>One day the strap was missing, and I could
find it, neither by searching, nor by open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
inquiry of my fellow white men, nor of the Indians,
whom I occasionally met. On one occasion,
while portaging my canoe to another lake,
I found several families of Indians camping at
the end of the portage. Among them was the
hunter who has been previously mentioned.
While stopping a moment for a friendly talk
with the Indians, I saw protruding from under
the coat of the hunter, nearly two feet of one
end of my missing pack strap. I knew it so
well that I was sure that it was no other pack
strap. Nevertheless, I deliberated slowly what
action I should take to recover the strap, not
wishing by any possibility to make a mistake.
Having surely concluded that the strap was
mine, and that the hunter had not come into
possession of it honestly&mdash;he having previously
denied, when questioned, that he knew anything
of the whereabouts of the strap&mdash;I decided
upon a course of action. Going up
quietly behind the hunter, and twisting the end
of the protruding strap twice around my wrist,
and grasping it firmly in my hand, I started
with all my might to run with the strap. The
effect was to make a temporary top of my
friend, the hunter, who whirled about until the
other end of the pack strap was released from
his body. It was too good a joke, even for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Indians to remain unmoved, and the majority
of them broke into merriment. The hunter at
first was disposed to take it seriously but soon
looked sheepish and ashamed, and tried to
smile with the rest of his tribe, as well as with
myself.</p>

<span class="caption">"One of the horses balked frequently".
(Page <a href="#Page_167">167</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>Having wound the strap carefully around my
own body, and having made sure that the ends
did not protrude, I bade my friends, including
the hunter, good day, got into my canoe and
pushed out into the lake. This proved to be the
last time I ever saw the hunter, but it was not
the last time that I ever thought of the incident.</p>

<p>In justice to the Indians as compared with
white men, I am glad to be able to say, that,
after mingling with them more or less for
many years, and becoming sufficiently familiar
with their language to be able to use it on all
necessary occasions, I believe that the Indians
are as honest and as honorable as the men with
whom they mingle, who have not a copper
skin.</p>

<p>Captain Martin was the last white man whom
any one of our party saw for four months.
Winter closed in on us before the beginning of
November. The snow became very deep, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that it was absolutely necessary to perform all
of our work on snowshoes. The winter of 1874
and 1875 is shown to have been the coldest
winter in Minnesota, of which there is any record,
beginning with 1819 up to, and including,
1913.</p>

<p>The party was mostly composed of men who
had had years of experience on the frontier,
and who were inured to hardship. With a few,
however, the experience was entirely new, and,
except that they were looked after by the more
hardy, they might have perished. As it was,
however, not one man became seriously ill at
any time during this severe winter's campaign.</p>

<p>All of the principal men of the party wore
light duck suits, made large enough to admit
of wearing heavy flannel underwear beneath
them. Either boot-packs or buckskin moccasins,
inside of which were several pairs of
woolen socks, composed the footwear. Boot-packs
or larigans, as they are commonly called
by the lumber-jack, are tanned in a manner
that makes them very susceptible to heat, and
the leather will shrivel quickly if near an open
fire. It cost one of the party several pairs of
boot-packs before he could learn to keep sufficiently
far away from the open fire, on returning
to camp from his work. It will be surmised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
by the reader that he was one of the inexperienced
of the party.</p>

<p>Many incidents, amusing to others, happened
during the winter to this same man. He
had started on the trip in the summer months,
with a supply of shoe blacking and paper collars.
The crossing of one or two portages with
his loaded pack sack on his back was sufficient
to convince him that there was no need of
carrying either shoe blacking or paper collars,
and they were thrown out to reduce weight.
Each man carried a hank or skein of thread, a
paper of needles, and a supply of buttons. Soon
after winter set in, this man, who might ordinarily
be termed a tenderfoot, complained of
lameness in one of his feet. As the weather
became more severe, he added from time to
time, another pair of socks to those he already
had on, never removing any of previous service.
This necessitated, not infrequently, his
choosing a larger sized boot-pack. Before the
campaign was over, although he was a man of
low stature and light weight, his feet presented
the appearance of being the largest in the
party. Still he complained of lameness in the
hollow of his foot, and no relief came until
March, when the work was completed. Arriving
once more back in civilization, he removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his much accumulated footwear. There, under
this accumulation of socks, and against the
hollow of his foot, was found his skein of
thread, the absence of which, from its usual
place, had necessitated his borrowing, whenever
he had need of it, from some one of his
companions. Before starting out on this campaign,
he had been one of the tidiest of men
about his personal appearance.</p>

<p>One evening in midwinter, when sitting
around the camp fire, by reason of the pile of
wood for the evening being largely composed
of dry balsam, we were kept more or less busy,
extinguishing sparks that are always thrown
out from this kind of wood when burning.
Sometimes one would light on the side of the
tent near by, and unless immediately extinguished,
would eat a large hole in the cloth.
That evening, Fendall G. Winston and I were
sitting side by side, when we saw a live spark
more than a quarter of an inch in diameter light
in the ear of our friend who sat a little way
from, and in front of us. It did not go out immediately,
neither did it disturb the tranquillity
of the young man. Mr. Winston and I exchanged
glances and smilingly watched the
ember slowly die. The time to clean up had
not yet arrived for at least one of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The compassman's work that winter was
rendered very laborious from the fact that his
occupation made it necessary for him, from
morning until night of every day, to break his
own path through the untrodden snow, for it
was he who was locating the line of the survey.
I was all of the time running lines in the interior
of the sections, following the work of the
surveyors, and choosing desirable pine timber
that was found within each section. I had no
companion in this work, and thus was separated
most of each day from other members
of the party, but returned to the same camp at
night.</p>

<p>In the morning, each man was furnished by
the cook, with a cloth sack in which were
placed one or two or more biscuits, containing
within, slices of fried bacon and sometimes
slices of corned beef, also, perhaps, a doughnut
or two. This he tied to the belt of his
jacket on his back and carried until the lunch
hour. Ordinarily a small fire was then kindled,
and the luncheon, which generally was frozen,
thawed out and eaten. Under such mode of
living, every one returned at night bringing an
appetite of ample dimensions.</p>

<p>One of the most acceptable of foods to such
men at the supper hour was bean soup, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
kind and quality such as a cook on the frontier,
alone, knows how to prepare. Plenty of good
bread was always in abundance at such time.
Usually there was also either corned beef or
boiled pork to be had by those who wished it;
generally also boiled rice or apple dumplings,
besides tea and coffee.</p>

<p>In a well-regulated camp, where men are living
entirely out of doors in tents, a bean hole
is pretty sure to be demanded. The bean hole
is prepared by first digging a hole in the
ground, sufficiently large, not only to make
room for the pail, but also for several inches of
live coals with which it must be surrounded.
After supper is over, the beans are put into a
large pail made of the best material, with ears
always riveted on, so that the action of heat
will not separate any of its parts. The beans
are first parboiled with a pinch of soda in the
water. As soon as the skins of the beans become
broken, the water is poured off; then the
beans are placed in the bean pail, a small quantity
of hot water is added together with a sufficiently
large piece of pork; and, when a tight
cover has been put on the pail, it is placed in
the bean hole. The live coals are placed around
it, until the hole is completely filled and the
pail entirely covered several inches deep. Then
ashes or earth are put on the top of it all, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
exclude the air. Thus the pail remains all
night, and, in the morning when the cook calls
the men to breakfast, the beans, thoroughly
cooked and steaming, are served hot and furnish
an acceptable foundation for the arduous
day's work about to begin.</p>

<span class="caption">"Our camp was made in a fine grove of
pig-iron Norway". (Page <a href="#Page_167">167</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>The work of the frontiersman is more or less
hazardous in its nature, and yet bad accidents
are rare. Occasionally a man is struck by a
falling limb, or he may be cut by the glancing
blow of an ax, though he learns to be very careful
when using tools, well knowing that there
is no surgeon or hospital near at hand. Sometimes
in the early winter, men unaccompanied,
yet obliged to travel alone, drop through the
treacherous ice and are drowned. Few winters
pass in a lumber country where instances of
this kind do not occur. One day, when alone,
I came near enough to such an experience. I
was obliged to cross a lake, known to have air
holes probably caused by warm springs. The
ice was covered by a heavy layer of snow, consequently
I wore snowshoes, and before starting
to cross, cut a long, stout pole. Taking
this firmly in my hands, I made my way out
onto the ice. All went well until I was near the
opposite shore, when suddenly the bottom
went out from under me and I fell into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
water, through an unseen air hole which the
snow covered. The pole I carried was sufficient
in length to reach the firm ice on either
side, which alone enabled me, after much labor,
impeded as I was by the cumbersome
snowshoes, to gain the surface. The next absolutely
necessary thing to do, was to make a
fire as quickly as possible, before I should become
benumbed by my wet garments.</p>

<p>The survey went steadily on, the snow and
cold increased, and rarely was it possible to
make an advance of more than four miles in a
day. Frank Hoyt remained at the warehouse
and watched the supplies which were steadily
diminishing. One day, Philip B. Winston, two
men of the crew, and I, set out to the supply
camp to bring some provisions to the cook's
camp. The first day at nightfall, we reached
an Indian wigwam that we knew of, situated
in a grove of hardwood timber, near the shore
of a lake, directly on our route to the supply
camp. Our little party stayed with the Indians
and shared their hospitality. It was a large
wigwam, covered principally with cedar bark,
and there was an additional smaller wigwam
so close to it, that a passage way was made
from one wigwam to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>In the smaller wigwam lived a young Indian,
his squaw, and the squaw's mother; in the
larger wigwam lived the chief, his wife, his
daughter, son-in-law, and the hunter, his wife,
and two daughters, all of whom were present
except the hunter. There was an air of expectancy
noticeable as we sat on the mats around
the fire in the wigwam, after having made
some coffee and eaten our supper outside.
Presently the chief informed us that an heir
was looked for that evening in the adjoining
tent. Before nine o'clock it was announced
that a young warrior had made his appearance,
and all were happy over his arrival. The large
pipe was brought forth, filled with tobacco,
and, after the chief had taken the first smoke,
it was passed around to their guests, and all
the men smoked, as well as the married women.</p>

<p>The next morning, we continued our journey
across the lake and on to Hoyt's camp,
where, it is needless to say, he was glad to see
some white men. Their visits were rare at his
camp. Filling our packs with things the cook
had ordered, we started on our return journey,
arriving at the Indian camp at nightfall. As
we left the ice to go up to the wigwams,
we met the mother of the young warrior
who had made his first appearance the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
night, going down to the lake with a pail
in each hand to bring some water to her wigwam.
The healthy young child was brought
into the wigwam and shown to the members
of our party, who complimented the young
mother and wished that he might grow to be a
brave, worthy to be chieftain of their tribe.</p>

<p>That evening a feast had been prepared at
the chief's wigwam, in honor of the birth of
the child, to which our party was invited. The
menu consisted principally of boiled rice,
boiled muskrat, and boiled rabbit. The three
principal foods having been cooked in one
kettle and at the same time, it was served as
one course, but the guests were invited to repeat
the course as often as they desired. This
invitation was accepted by some, while others
seemed satisfied to take the course but once.
I have always found the hospitality of the
Chippewa Indian unsurpassed, and more than
once, in my frontier experiences, I have found
that hospitality a godsend to me and to my
party.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>The Entire Party Moves to
Swan River.</b></big></div>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">It was in the month of February,
1875, when the surveying party completed
its work east of Bow String
Lake, and finished, one afternoon,
closing its last lines on the Third Guide Meridian.
At the camp, that afternoon, preparations
were being made for a general move of
considerable distance. It is not always possible
for the frontiersman to reach his goal on
the day that he has planned to do so. An instance
in point occurred next day, when our
surveying party was moving out to Grand
Rapids. The snow was deep and the weather
intensely cold when we broke camp that morning,
hoping before nightfall to reach one of
Hill Lawrence's logging camps. Some Indians
had been hired to help pack out our belongings.
Our course lay directly through the unbroken
forest, without trail or blazed line, and the
right direction was kept only by the constant
use of the compass. All were on snowshoes,
and those of the party who could be depended
upon to correctly use the compass, took turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in breaking road. Each compassman would
break the way through the snow for half an
hour, then another would step in and break the
way for another half hour, and he in turn
would be succeeded by a third compassman.
This change of leadership was continued all
the way during that day.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon, the Indians
threw down their packs and left our
party altogether, having become tired of their
jobs. This necessitated dividing up the Indians'
packs and each man sufficiently able-bodied
taking a part of these abandoned loads
in addition to his own pack; and thus we continued
the journey.</p>

<p>Night was fast approaching, and the distance
was too great to reach the Lawrence
camp that night. Fortunately, there were
some Indian wigwams not far in advance.
These we reached after nightfall, and, as our
party was very tired and carried no prepared
food, we asked for shelter during the night,
with the Indians. They soon made places
where our men could spread their blankets
around the small fire in the center of the wigwams.
Then we asked if we could be served
with something to eat. We received an affirmative
"Ugh," and the squaws commenced
preparing food, which consisted solely of a
boiled rabbit stew with a little wild rice. It
was once more demonstrated that hunger is a
good cook. After having partaken of the unselfishly
proffered food, and, after most of our
party had smoked their pipes, all lay down
about the fire, and fell asleep. Even the presence
of Indian dogs, occasionally walking over
us in the night, interfered but little with our
slumbers. The next morning our party started
out without breakfast, and by ten o'clock
reached the Lawrence camp, where the cook
set out, in a few minutes' time, a great variety
of food, and an abundance of it, of which each
man partook to his great satisfaction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 697px;">
<img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="697" height="900" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"These little animals were numerous".

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>From Lawrence camp we were able to secure
the services of the tote team that was going
out for supplies, which took our equipment
through to Grand Rapids. From that point,
we were able, also, to hire a team to take our
supplies to the Swan River. Crossing this
we went north to survey two townships, which
would complete the winter's contract.</p>

<p>It has been stated that this winter of 1874
and 1875 was the coldest of which the Weather
Bureau for Minnesota furnishes any history.
Besides the intense cold, there were heavy
snows. Nevertheless, no serious injury or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
physical suffering of long duration befell any
member of our band of hardy woodsmen. Not
one of our number was yet thirty years old,
the youngest one being eighteen. Two only
of the party were married, Fendall G. Winston,
and myself. On leaving Grand Rapids in August,
we separated ourselves from all other
white men. The party was as completely separated
from the outside world as though it had
been aboard a whaling vessel in the Northern
Seas. No letters nor communications of any
kind reached us after winter set in, until our
arrival in Grand Rapids in the month of February
following. Letters were occasionally
written and kept in readiness to send out by
any Indian who might be going to the nearest
logging camp, whence they might by chance
be carried out to some post office. Whether
these letters reached their destinations or not,
could not be known by the writers as long as
they remained on their work, hidden in the
forest.</p>

<p>I had left my young wife and infant daughter,
not yet a year old, in Minneapolis. Either,
or both might have died and been buried before
any word could have reached me. It was
not possible at all times to keep such thoughts
out of my mind. Of course every day was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
busy one, completely filled with the duties of
the hour, and the greatest solace was found in
believing that all was well even though we
could not communicate with each other. As I
recall, no ill befell any one of the party nor of
the party's dear ones, during all these long
weeks and months of separation. Every man
of the party seemed to become more rugged
and to possess greater endurance as the cold
increased. It became the common practice to
let the camp fire burn down and die, as we
rolled into our blankets to sleep till the morning
hour of arising.</p>

<p>Not every night was spent in comfort, however,
though ordinarily that was the average
experience. The less robust ones, of whom
there were very few, sometimes received special
attention.</p>

<p>It was during the arduous journey, getting
away from the scene of our first survey to that
of the upper waters of Swan River, that one of
our men fell behind all of the others, on a hard
day's tramp. P. B. Winston, who had all the
time been very considerate of him, observing
that he was not keeping up to the party, but
was quite a long way back on the trail which
the men were breaking through the snow, said
that he would wait for him until he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
catch up. Concealing himself behind a thicket
close to the trail, he quietly awaited our friend's
arrival. He told the following incident of the
poor fellow's condition:</p>

<p>Mr. Winston allowed him to pass him on the
trail, unobserved, and heard him saying, as he
rubbed one of his legs, "Oh Lord, my God,
what ever made me leave my comfortable home
and friends, and come out into this wilderness!"
At this instant Mr. Winston called out,
"What is the matter &mdash;&mdash;?" "Oh, I'm
freezing, and I don't know that I shall ever be
of any use if I ever get out," he replied. He
did live to get out and to reach his friends,
none the worse for his doleful experience. He
did not again, however, go north into the forest,
but tried another portion of the western
country, where he became very prosperous.</p>

<p>Long living around the open camp fire in the
winter months, standing around in the smoke,
and accumulating more or less of the odors
from foods of various kinds being cooked by
the open fire, invariably result in all of one's
clothing and all of one's bedding becoming
more or less saturated with the smell of the
camp. This condition one does not notice
while living in it from day to day, but he does
not need to be out and away from such environments
for more than a few hours, before he becomes
personally conscious, to some degree,
that such odors are not of a quality that would
constitute a marketable article for cash. On
arriving in Minneapolis at the close of the winter's
campaign, without having changed our
garments&mdash;as we had none with us that had not
shared with us one and the same fate&mdash;Mr.
P. B. Winston and I engaged a hack at the railroad
station, and drove to our respective
homes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Mr. Winston's domicile that was first
reached, and it happened, as the driver stopped
in front of his house, that his fiancée, Miss Kittie
Stevens (the first white child born in Minneapolis),
chanced to be passing by. Of course
their meeting was unexpected to either, but
was a pleasant and joyous one, though somewhat
embarrassing to Mr. Winston. The wind
was blowing, and I noticed that he took the
precaution to keep his own person out of the
windward. He had been a soldier in the Confederate
Army, and I smiled with much satisfaction
as I observed his splendid maneuver.</p>

<p>On meeting me next day, Mr. Winston inquired
whether his tactics had been observed,
and, being assured that they had, he said that
that was the embarrassing moment for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for he did not know but that the young lady
might have considered that she had just
grounds for breaking the engagement. Both
of us, however, knew better, for she was a
young lady possessed of a large degree of common
sense and loveliness. The young people
later were married, Mr. Winston becoming
mayor of Minneapolis, remaining always, one
of its best citizens. Often, afterwards, incidents
of that winter's experience, a few of which
have been herein recorded, were gone over together
with great pleasure by the parties interested.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Methods of Acquiring Government
Land&mdash;An Abandoned
Squaw.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_f.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">For many years it was the practice of
the United States government, after
its lands had been surveyed, to advertise
them for sale at public auction
on a date fixed by the government. Time
sufficient was always given to allow parties interested
to go themselves, or send men into
the woods, to examine the lands, and thus to
be prepared on the day of sale, to bid as high
a price on any description as each was willing
to pay. After the time advertised for the lands
to be thus offered, had expired, and after the
land sale had been held, all lands not bought in
at that sale became subject to private entry at
the local land office. It was this class of lands
that I bought in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>After the Civil War, by act of Congress, each
Union soldier was given the right to homestead
one hundred and sixty acres of land, the
government price of which was one dollar and
twenty-five cents per acre. It sometimes happened
that the soldier found only forty acres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or possibly eighty acres, or one hundred and
twenty acres, lying contiguous, that he cared
to take as a homestead. Later, Congress
passed another law enabling the soldier, who
had thus previously entered fewer than one
hundred and sixty acres, to take an additional
homestead claim of enough acres, which, when
added to his previous homestead, would make
a total of one hundred and sixty acres. The
soldier was not obliged to live on this additional
piece of land, but had the right to sell his
certificate or scrip from the government, to
anyone who might choose to buy it, and the
purchaser, by power of attorney from the soldier,
could with this scrip, himself enter the
land. This became a common practice, covering
a period of several years, and it was with
the use of this kind of scrip that very much
of the land that was surveyed about the time I
have been describing, was entered.</p>

<p>In the following winter&mdash;that of 1875 and
1876&mdash;I was in the woods of Minnesota west
of Cloquet, accompanied by an Indian named
Antoine, and, while breaking trail on snowshoes
in the deep snow along an obscure road
that had been cut through to Grand Rapids, on
the Mississippi, I came to a small Indian tepee
close by the side of the road. A little smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was curling from its peak, and a piece of an old
blanket was hanging over its entrance. Calling
aloud, I heard a faint voice of a woman answering
from within. Entering the wigwam,
we found there an impoverished, half-clad,
half-frozen, perishing squaw. She told us that
her feet had been frozen so that she could not
walk, and that her family had left her to die.
She had food enough, and possibly fuel enough,
to last her about two more days. I was at a
loss to know what was the wisest and most
humane thing to do. We were far in the woods,
and away from every human inhabitant. It
was as easy to proceed to Grand Rapids as it
was to retrace our steps to Duluth. A decision
was soon made, and that was, that we would
cut and split, and bring inside the wigwam a
large pile of good wood, with plenty of kindling,
and would leave the poor woman supplies
from our pack sacks, of things most suitable
and most convenient for her to use, as
whatever she did, must be done on her hands
and knees.</p>

<p>Having provided her with a liberal supply of
rice, pork, crackers, some flour, sugar, tea, and
a package of smoking tobacco&mdash;for all squaws
smoke&mdash;besides melting snow until we had
filled an old pail with water, we felt that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
could keep herself alive and comfortable for
several days, at least. I then took out of my
pack, a new pair of North Star camping
blankets, and cutting them in two, left one-half
to provide additional warmth for the unfortunate
squaw. As is the custom of her people
when something much appreciated has been
done for one of them, she took my hand and
kissed it. Leaving her plenty of matches, we
bade her good-by, and resumed our journey
toward Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>Once more on the trail, I asked Antoine how
old he believed the squaw to be. He said maybe
forty; I should have judged her to have been
seventy, but no doubt I was mistaken, and the
Indian's judgment was far better. Arriving at
Grand Rapids, I wrote the authorities at Duluth,
and at Fond du Lac Indian Reservation,
telling them of the poor woman's situation and
where she was located. I afterwards learned
that she had been sent for, and brought out by
team, and that she had been subsequently taken
to her band of Indians.</p>

<p>I have been told by different Indians, that
the sick and the aged are sometimes abandoned
when the band is very short of provisions, and
when to take the helpless with them, would
prove a great burden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>United States Land Sale at
Duluth&mdash;Joe LaGarde.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_d.jpg" width="100" height="101" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">During the summer of 1882, the
United States government had advertised
that it would offer at public
auction, many townships of land lying
along the border between Minnesota and
Canada, in Cook, Lake, St. Louis, and Itasca
Counties. This country was difficult to reach.
The distance from Duluth to Lake Vermilion
was upwards of ninety miles. There was not
even a road through the woods, over which a
loaded team could be driven. Men were
obliged to take their supplies upon their backs
and carry them over a trail, all of this distance.
From Lake Vermilion, it was possible to work
both eastward and westward, by using canoes
and making numerous portages from one lake
to another, and so on for seventy-five miles in
either direction along the boundary. Supplies
were soon exhausted, so that it was necessary
to keep packers on the trail, bringing in on
their backs, fresh supplies from Duluth to Vermilion,
where now is located the city of Tower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
In the Vermilion country, dog trains could
sometimes be advantageously used.</p>

<p>Estimators of timber were employed either
for themselves or for others, in surveying the
lands, and in estimating the pine timber in
these various townships that were to be offered
at public sale in the month of December.
This work continued almost to the day when
the sale was to begin. That sale was held at
the local land office at Duluth, and there were
present men interested in the purchase of pine
timber, from Maine, Pennsylvania, New York,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and some
men representing Canadian capital. The competition
was vigorous, and Uncle Sam's lands
were bid in at a round price.</p>

<p>During the fall of 1882, while preparing for
the approaching land sale at Duluth, the only
son of William S. Patrick, Simeon D. Patrick,
a veteran land examiner in my employ, and I,
made a short trip west of Duluth, exploring a
section of country south of where now is the
station of Cornwall, on the Northern Pacific
Railroad. Our packer and handy man who carried
part of our supplies, was an Indian of considerable
note, by the name of John LaGarde,
familiarly known as Joe LaGarde. He was a
fine specimen of Chippewa Indian trapper, tall,
straight, muscular, and a good burden bearer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
but rather averse to long days' work. He was
handy about camp, but, being an Indian, and
accustomed to lying down at night with his
feet close to a few live embers, he did not share
with the white man the wish for large piles of
wood to last through the cold nights that prevailed
during this trip.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="900" height="675" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"The roots of the lilies are much relished as a food
by the moose." (Page <a href="#Page_172">172</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>It happened that one evening we pitched
our tent near a small stream, in a grove composed
principally of young birch, but interspersed
with large and shaggy ones. Everyone
at all familiar with the birch knows there is
much of it, on which the outer bark peels naturally,
and it is no uncommon thing to be able
to peel, with the use of the hands only, large
quantities of the bark. There was almost an
inexhaustible supply of just such bark near
this camping ground. Joe was either tired or
indisposed to work that evening, and when
bedtime arrived, the pile of wood looked very
scant for the long hours of the night. No one
likes a little innocent fun better than my friend
Patrick. Looking at the small woodpile, then
at Joe, Patrick gave me a twinkle of his eye,
started out into the semidarkness, and commenced
peeling bark off the birch trees. He
busied himself thus, until he had peeled off and
brought in near our tent, a huge pile of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
beautiful birch bark.</p>

<p>No matter how rainy the weather may be,
or how deep the snow in winter, if the frontiersman
is fortunate enough to be camped in
a grove of live birch, he knows that this ever
friendly and useful birch bark will afford him a
sure means of kindling a fire. It carries much
oil and burns readily when a match is applied
to it. The fire was fixed for the night, and
Patrick and I lay down in our tent under our
blankets to sleep. Joe, as was his custom,
curled up at the foot of the tent and left his
bare feet sticking out toward the fire. His requirement
of blanket was less than half of what
would satisfy a white man. As long as his feet
were warm, the Indian did not suffer from cold.
About midnight the fire had burned very low,
when Patrick emerged from the tent and commenced
dropping pieces of birch bark on the
fast consuming fire logs. I was well back in
the tent, propped up a little on my elbows, enjoying
the glow of the fire, and watching it, as
well as watching the Indian. As the fire increased
and the flames rose higher, the Indian's
feet began to twitch, and to draw up
closer to his body. Soon the heat was so tremendous
that the tent was in danger, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
like a missile, thrown by a strong spring, the
Indian shot out of his blanket and into the
woods, muttering his imprecations in Chippewa.
He did not swear, for praise be to the
Chippewa language, it contains no such words;
but a madder Indian and a happier white man
are seldom seen. The sequel to this episode
was plenty of good fuel to burn during all of
the following nights of this cruise in the forest.</p>

<p>We employed LaGarde on other and later
trips, and his services were always satisfactory.
He has since gone to the happy hunting
ground, and, with his passing, a tinge of sadness
steals over us, for his memory is dear, and
we have no right or wish to count him as other
than our brother. He was always true to the
white man, and deserves his meed of praise.</p>

<p>An account of his death appeared in the Duluth
Herald, February 28th, 1911, from which
the following summary is gathered:</p>

<p>His age is given in the death certificate, as
one hundred years. He was born on the Red
Lake Indian Reservation, near Thief River
Falls. His mother was a full-blooded Chippewa,
and his father a half-breed with a
French-Canadian name. In 1834, when about
twenty-four years old, he came with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
mother, to the Head of the Lakes, and settled
at the historic John Jacob Astor Trading Post,
at Fond du Lac. Three years later, while trading
at Madeleine Island, near Bayfield, he met
Liola Chievier, a half-breed, whom he afterwards
married and brought to Fond du Lac.
There were seven children to this union, but
only three are now living. The youngest, aged
fifty-five, lived at Fond du Lac with his father.
The other two were located on the White
Earth Reservation. They were Moses and Simon.
The old man's wife died about thirty-eight
years ago. LaGarde lived in Fond du
Lac about seventy-seven years. He possessed
a remarkable physique. His chest was well developed,
his body straight as an arrow, and he
stood six feet two inches in height. Being a
Chippewa, LaGarde loved peace more than
war, and he never took part in any Indian outbreak.
As far back as the memory of any
white man of the suburb goes, he had a reputation
of being honest in all his transactions with
the white traders. His body was buried in the
Indian burying grounds, at the Fond du Lac
Indian Reservation near Cloquet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Six Hundred Miles in a
Birch Canoe.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">The following summer, I hired a number
of men to pack some supplies
from Duluth to the shores of Lake
Vermilion. I had with me one white
man to assist me in a reestimate of the pine
timber that I had bought at the land sale in December.
Canoes were purchased of the Indians,
and I employed some of them to go as packers
and canoemen.</p>

<p>The work first took the party eastward a distance
of fifty miles. Not only was the timber
reexamined, but the character of the streams
was carefully noted, with reference to their
feasibility for floating out the timber, whenever
the time should come for it to be cut and
brought to market. All of that country is very
rugged and much broken. The shores of the
lakes are bold and rock-bound. Islands exist
in nearly all of the lakes, and at that time they
were thoroughly wooded, many of them containing
fine bunches of pine timber. The country
was picturesque and the scenery most enchanting.
Aquatic birds of various species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
were frequently startled from the water as our
canoes came in sight of them. Fish were
abundant and could be taken in almost any one
of the lakes, by throwing out a line. There
were caribou and moose in the country, but
no deer at that time.</p>

<p>Bands of Indians were living along these
waters, most of them belonging to the United
States, but, as we turned and went westward,
on the waters of Lake La Croix we met many
Canadian Indians. They all spoke the same
language, though sometimes with great difference
in accent. There were many waterfalls,
and around these, in every instance, a portage
had to be made of all our supplies and of our
canoes. One day's experience was much like
that of its predecessor or like that of the one to
follow. On the whole, the work was less arduous
than that in a country which is mostly
land and not cut up by numerous lakes, as is
the condition in all of the northern woods in
Minnesota. A camping ground would be selected
on a shore of a lake, and, from this one
camp, it was often our experience that several
days' work could be economically accomplished
before it was necessary to again move. The
timber that we wished to examine often lay on
either side of the lake on the shore of which the
camping ground had been selected. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
work continued until the party reached Rainy
Lake. This lake is fifty-five miles long, and at
its foot, at that time, on the Canadian side, was
Fort Francis. Much of this water route was
then known as the Dawson Route. It had been
used by the Canadian government to reach the
Canadian Northwest with its soldiers, at the
time of the Riel Rebellion. The shattered remains
of a number of French batteaus were
seen on the rapids between different lakes,
where an attempt had been made to navigate
the waters, which had disastrously failed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="900" height="616" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"We have seen the moose standing out in the
bays of the lakes". (Page <a href="#Page_172">172</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>Just below Fort Francis, which is at the beginning
of the Rainy River which flows into
Lake of the Woods, we found a Canadian
farmer. He had been an engineer on board a
Canadian steamer that plied from Rat Portage
to Fort Francis. When the rebellion was over,
and there was no longer use for steamboating,
this man determined to take a homestead under
the Canadian land laws. This was at the
latter end of July. While our party was preparing
dinner on the bank of the river at the
edge of the settler's meadow, he came down to
see us. It was seldom that he saw any of the
white race, and, when one chanced to pass by,
he was always glad, he said, to see him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
learn something of the outside world. He invited
us to go back into his meadow where, he
assured us, we should find an abundance of
ripe, wild strawberries. This we found to be
true, and the berries were indeed a luxury to a
lot of men who had been living on nothing better
than dried peaches or dried apples, stewed
and made into sauce.</p>

<p>The work of examining lands was now completed
for this trip, but the easiest way out was
to continue down Rainy River into Lake of the
Woods, and across Lake of the Woods to Rat
Portage, where a train on the Canadian Pacific
could be boarded and the journey continued
to Winnipeg, and from thence by rail
back to Minneapolis. At that time no logs
had been driven down the Rainy River to mar
the beauty of its shore lines which were the
most beautiful of any river I have ever seen in
Minnesota or in Canada. In some places for
half a mile at a stretch there would be a continuous
gravel shore. Its waters were deep
and clear.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of Rainy River, our party
overtook Colonel Eaton and his helper, a man
from Wisconsin, whose name, I believe, was
Davis. Colonel Eaton was United States government
inspector of lands, and was on a tour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of inspection to ascertain to what extent the
land laws relating to homestead entries were
being complied with. Each was glad to meet
the other, and in company, we traveled from
that time until we finally arrived at Rat Portage.</p>

<p>Lake of the Woods is a very large body of
water, and not everywhere is it safe to venture
out upon it in small boats or canoes. Colonel
Eaton had a staunch rowboat. At Rainy Lake
I had paid off and dismissed most of my helpers,
so that I had but one canoe remaining.
This was occupied by myself and the white
man, my assistant, whom I had taken at the
beginning of the journey. For a considerable
distance, the party was able to keep behind the
islands and away from the open lake, until it
arrived at a point that is known as a traverse,
a wide opening between islands, where the
westerly winds, if blowing heavily, have a tremendous
sweep. Our party found the whitecaps
rolling in across this traverse, on the top
of waves so high that neither of our crafts
could possibly live, if out in them. Here, on
this island, we went ashore and made our camp
as comfortable as possible while waiting for
the wind and waves to subside.</p>

<p>Both parties had been long from home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
were practically without food to eat. We were
obliged to stay on that island three nights and
two days before the water had calmed sufficiently
for us to cross the traverse. In the
meantime, we had eaten the last of our supplies,
and were subsisting wholly upon what
blueberries we were able to find growing on
the island. Some public work was about to begin
up the Rainy River, and we had been informed
that a steamer from Rat Portage,
loaded with various articles of merchandise,
was liable to come up the lake to enter the river
at almost any time; consequently we were continually
on the lookout for the steamer, it being
the only source from which we could hope to
get anything to eat, before we should arrive at
Rat Portage. Finally the steamer was spied
on the afternoon of the second day of our unforeseen
residence on the island. With towels
tied to poles, our party, hoping to be able to
signal the passing steamer, went to the shore
of the island. It was well out on the lake from
our shore, and our hopes began to wane as we
saw it steam by us, not having given us any indication
that it had seen our signal. Suddenly,
however, our fears were turned to hope and
joy as we saw its bow turning in our direction.
It made a long sweep on account of the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sea, and came in behind our island where the
water was deep, and the nose of the steamer
was brought almost to our shore. We quickly
told the captain our plight, and asked only that
we might purchase of him a little flour and a
little meat, a little tea and a little coffee, sufficient
to take us to Rat Portage, including a
possible longer delay on the island because of
the wind that was yet blowing. This he gladly
gave us, refusing to accept any compensation;
and with grateful hearts, we waved him adieu
as the boat resumed its course. The following
morning, early, the lake was quite calm; and,
after a hasty breakfast, we pulled out from
shore, crossed the traverse, and once more got
behind the friendly islands. From this time
on to Rat Portage, our journey was without
special interest, the party returning together
by rail to Minneapolis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Effect of Discovery of Iron Ore
on Timber Industry.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_d.jpg" width="100" height="101" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">During the same year that the
United States government offered its
lands in the northern counties of
Minnesota at public auction, new interests
effecting the market for pine timber
were created by the discovery of iron ore of a
marketable quality, near the south shore of
Lake Vermilion, where now is the city of Tower,
Minnesota.</p>

<p>Historically, the first mention of iron ore in
northern Minnesota dates back to the report of
J. G. Norwood, made in 1850, in which he mentioned
the occurrence of iron ore at Gunflint
Lake, but claimed no commercial importance
in his discovery. The Geological and Natural
History Survey of Minnesota, Volume 4, page
583, records the following: "H. H. Eames,
state geologist of Minnesota in 1865 and 1866,
was the first to observe and report iron ore on
both the Vermilion and Mesabi ranges, and to
consider it of any value. In his report for 1866,
he describes the ore outcroppings near the
southern shore of Lake Vermilion, and in his
report, published the following year, is an account
of the ore at Prairie River Falls, on the
western end of the Mesabi, and several analyses
showing it to be of good quality."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="900" height="714" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"White Pine&mdash;What of Our Future
Supply?" (Page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>As early as 1880, Professor A. H. Chester, in
the interest of private parties, made a personal
examination of the Vermilion Iron Range, and
predicted that an iron ore district of immense
value and importance would be found to exist
on that range. George C. Stone of Duluth, one
of the parties who had employed Chester to
make the examination for iron ore, was elected
a member of the Minnesota legislature, and,
through his instrumentality, in 1881, a law was
passed, "to encourage mining in this state, by
providing a uniform rate for the taxing of mining
properties and products." This law provided
for a payment of a tax of fifty cents for
each ton of copper, and one cent for each ton of
iron ore, mined and shipped or disposed of;
each ton to be estimated as containing two
thousand two hundred and forty pounds. The
Duluth and Iron Range Railroad was constructed
from Two Harbors, on Lake Superior,
to Tower, Minnesota; and in August, 1884, the
first shipment of iron ore was made from the
Minnesota Mine at Tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Promising outcrops of iron ore bearing rocks
were found east of Tower, where now is the
flourishing town of Ely. Work was begun on
these outcrops, resulting in the finding of the
Chandler Mine, by Captain John Pengilly, from
which, in 1888, the first shipment of iron ore
was made, the railroad having been extended
from Tower to Ely, for the purpose, primarily,
of shipping the iron ore to Two Harbors, and
thence to the eastern markets. Other mines
were later found in this vicinity. The building
and equipping of this railroad created a demand
for manufactured lumber, for railroad
ties, and for telegraph poles. Sawmills were
built at different points along the line of the
railroad and at its terminals, so that the years
immediately following were busy ones for
those dealing in standing timber and its manufactured
products.</p>

<p>My associates and I had acquired interests
in these localities, so that much of my time for
nearly a decade, was actively employed along
the line of the Vermilion Range. During these
years from 1882 to 1888, the most practical
modes of travel, and almost the only ones, were
either by birch canoe and portaging from lake
to lake in summer, or by dog train during the
winter. Sometimes these trips were pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
ones, but quite as often they were attended by
incidents not always agreeable.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions late in October,
accompanied by one white man known only as
"Buffalo," I started to travel east from Tower,
on Lake Vermilion, along the route followed
by the Indians, to the foot of Fall Lake, a distance
of forty-five miles. It was some time after
noon when we pulled out from shore in our
two-man canoe, a small craft, affording just
room for two men to sit, and to carry their
pack sacks and scant supplies. Soon it began
to rain, and the wind commenced blowing. We
were approaching an island, when Buffalo, who
had had much experience on the Great Lakes
as a sailor, insisted that we could not reach our
landing at the easterly end of the lake, before
dark, without the use of a sail. Arriving at an
island, we pulled our canoe ashore, and Buffalo
quickly improvised a sail, which was hoisted in
the bow of the canoe and the boat was again
launched. In this manner we sailed and paddled
at a much accelerated speed, but all of the
time we were in imminent danger of being capsized,
it being my first experience of riding in a
birch canoe carrying a sail. Fortune favored
the undertaking, however, and we made a safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
landing in time to pitch our tent and make our
camp for the night.</p>

<p>During the night the cold increased, and
when we arose in the morning, we found that
ice had formed on the water in the little bay
of the lake. We made a number of portages
that day, the cold increasing so that in all of
the little bays, ice was forming. We succeeded
in crossing Burnt Side Lake and entering the
river leading to Long Lake as it was getting
dark. We were then six miles from what we
knew to be a comfortable ranch near the lower
end of Long Lake, which Buffalo strongly
urged we should try to reach that night, although
to do so meant that we must pass between
some islands where, in places, we knew
the rocks projected out of the water, and therefore
were perilous to our birch canoe. We decided
to make the effort, and soon after pushing
out from shore, we were only able to faintly
discern the outlines of the islands that we must
pass. Fortunately, these were soon alongside
of us, and we had passed the last dangerous
reef of rocks. Then, to our great satisfaction,
we saw the light from the lantern which had
been hung out on a pile driven close by the
outer end of the dock at the foot of the lake,
about four miles distant, where the ranch, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
we hoped to reach that night, was located. The
wind had died down so that the surface of the
lake was comparatively smooth, but we noticed
that our mittens, which had become thoroughly
wet, were freezing on our hands. For
one hour we paddled in silence, when the light
toward which we had been steering, became
much more visible, and soon we landed at the
little dock, thankful that we had made our
journey safely. Our appetites were keen for
the good, broiled steak and hot potatoes that
previous experience had taught us we were
pretty sure to receive, and in this we were not
disappointed.</p>

<p>The following summer, I passed over this
same canoe route under quite different circumstances.
My work of examining lands and timber
all lay near to the shores of several lakes.
My wife's father, J. H. Conkey, and her
brother, Frank L. Conkey, had often expressed
a wish to see that northern country. Accompanied
by them and also by my son, Frank
Merton, who was then a boy in short pants, we
journeyed by rail to Tower. Before leaving
Duluth for Tower, Mose Perrault was added
to our number.</p>

<p>Perrault was a fine specimen of man, six feet
in height, well-proportioned, of middle age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and thoroughly familiar with frontier life. At
Tower, we started out with two birch canoes,
and after dinner, on a pleasant afternoon in August,
we pushed our canoes out into the waters
of Lake Vermilion, from the same point from
which we had left in the rain, the previous October.
We reached the east end of Vermilion
early, portaged into Mud Lake, went up the
river, and camped on the high ground west of
Burnt Side Lake, in a pine grove where we
were surrounded by blueberry bushes laden
with their large, ripe fruit.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Our party was made up of two classes of
people; one out to examine timber, the other,
to fish and have a good time. While crossing
one of the portages, my brother-in-law, Frank
L. Conkey, who knew almost nothing about
canoeing or portaging, but was willing, and
full of hard days' work, picked up two pack
sacks, one of which was strapped to his
shoulders, and the other was placed on top of
his shoulders and the back of his head. Thus
burdened, he started across Mud Portage, the
footing of which, in places, was very insecure.
At an unfortunate moment, he caught his foot
in a root and tumbled, the top pack sack shooting
over his head and breaking open at its fastenings,
thus spilling its contents on the
ground. All that could be found of these, were
gathered together and replaced in the pack
sack, and the journey was resumed. Mose Perrault
was the cook, and on arriving at the
camping ground at night, he began preparations
for making bread and getting the evening
meal. The pack sack that had broken open,
originally contained two tin cans, one filled
with baking powder, and the other, with fresh
live worms buried in earth, that had been gathered
for bait for the fishing party. Perrault
wanted the baking powder with which to
leaven the dough. The fishermen wanted their
worms with which to bait their hooks. The
latter were gratified, but nowhere could the
baking powder be found, and we were forced
to the conclusion that it was one of the lost articles
on the portage. That night and the next
day, we lived on bread made without any
leaven, which from a number of experiences, I
feel competent to state, is never a great success.
The fishing, however, was good, and on
the portages enough partridges were shot within
revolver range to afford plenty of good meat
for the party. These we cooked with bacon
and dressed with butter, of which we had a
goodly supply. There were plenty of crackers
and Carolina rice, with blueberries close at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hand for the picking, so that the party subsisted
well, until it arrived at Ely, where the
three fishermen bade Perrault and me farewell,
returning to their homes by railroad train,
after a pleasant outing.</p>

<p>In February, 1891, my three companions and
I had a very different experience, away east of
Ely, where we had gone to survey and estimate
a tract of pine timber. The snow was deep,
and the journey, which had to be made with the
use of toboggans, was a hard one. I had, as
my associate and chief timber estimator, S. D.
Patrick. In addition were the cook, and Buffalo,
a man whose name has appeared on a previous
page. This man is worthy of more than
passing notice. His true name I never knew.
He always said, "Call me 'Buffalo'." He
claimed to have been born at Buffalo, New
York, and to have spent his childhood and
early youth in that city. He was an Irish-American
and was possessed of the typical
Irish wit on all occasions. He was never angry
to the extent of being disagreeable, but he had
no patience for any man in the party who refused
or neglected to do his full share of the
work. He claimed that when a boy, he had
earned money at the steamboat landings at
Buffalo, by diving under the water for coins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
thrown to him by passengers on board the
ships at anchor in the harbor, as did also the
late Daniel O'Day of the Standard Oil Company.
He too, was an Irish-American, born
and raised near Buffalo, and at his death left
millions of dollars. He once told me that when
a youth he had earned many dimes and quarters
by diving for them alongside the passenger
ships in Buffalo Harbor.</p>

<p>Buffalo was always ready to act promptly
and to do, or to undertake to do, anything that
was requested of him. On this occasion he had
an opportunity to demonstrate these good
qualities. The trip was attended with the
greatest of hardships, of heavy work, and of
exposure to intense cold. Buffalo was a good
axman, and not one night did he fail to cut
and pile near to the camp, enough wood to last
until after breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>Our camp was established on the shores of
Kekekabic Lake, in Township 64 N., Range
7 W., for several days and nights. There were
many partridges in this section of the forest.
They would come out on the borders of the
woods next to the lake. It was possible to
shoot one or more nearly every day, so that the
camp was supplied with fresh game. The cook
and Buffalo remained at the camp, while Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Patrick and I went out each day to examine
timber, returning at night. The daylight covered
none too many hours, so that we arose
early and started on our journey after breakfast,
as soon as we could see to travel, in order
that the day's work might be accomplished,
and the return to camp made before dark. It
was not possible to calculate the day's work so
as to be sure that we could reach camp before
nightfall, but, owing to the intense cold that
prevailed at this time, it was only the part of
wisdom to plan so as to return to camp while
we could yet see where to travel. Nearly every
day's work was, in part at least, over a new
tract of land, to which a new trail must be
broken in the morning as we went out to the
work.</p>

<p>One day our work lay directly north of our
camp, through the woods, out onto a small lake,
and again into the woods. We knew, before
leaving camp in the morning, that it would require
our best efforts to accomplish the work
and to return before nightfall. For this reason,
we started at daybreak, and, after having done
our best, it was night before we commenced to
retrace our steps. The cold had increased all
day, so that we were obliged to summon our
courage at times, to keep our feet and hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
from freezing. We were only two miles from
camp when our return journey began; but two
miles in an unbroken wilderness, in deep snow,
with the only path to follow being the tracks
made by two men passing once over it, is a long
distance to travel when daylight has disappeared,
and when to leave those tracks at such
a temperature, would probably prove fatal.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes from the time of our
beginning to retrace our steps, each step was
taken by the sense of feeling. We were both
clad in moccasins, which made it possible,
through the sense of feeling, to distinguish
between the unbroken snow and that which
had been stepped upon during the morning
hours of that day. Being in darkness, we dared
not proceed whenever we were not certain that
our feet were in the path that we had made on
going out to our work. A few times we lost
the path. Immediately we stopped, one man
standing still, in order that we might not lose
our location, while the other felt around until
the path was regained. We knew that if we
should lose it, the one thing remaining for us
would be to walk around a tree, if it were possible
to do so, until morning light should appear.
We went slowly on, never giving up hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It was getting late in the evening, so that
Buffalo, at camp, became alarmed for our safety.
His wits were at work, and he commenced
to build a large fire. Then he found, near by,
a dead pine stub. About this he piled kindling
until he got it on fire. It is not possible to
write words describing the satisfaction and joy
with which we two lonely travelers finally
spied the illumination, penetrating the dark
forest for a short distance only, it is true, yet
far enough. Soon we walked into camp, to the
joy of all of the party, and there we found an
excellent supper awaiting us. Buffalo's big
wood pile was in waiting at all the hours of
that night, and some one was astir to keep the
fire going. It was the only night of my long
experience of living in the woods, when it was
impossible, for more than a short period, to be
comfortable away from the fire, and even then,
we each in turn revolved our bodies about the
open fire, first warming one side, and then the
other, and slept but little.</p>

<p>After our work was completed, and we had
gotten back in touch with the civilized world,
we were told by residents at Tower, that the
thermometer on that night, had indicated from
48° to 52° below zero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The following summer, on one of my trips to
this then picturesque country in northeastern
Minnesota, I tried the experiment of taking my
wife, who had long been an invalid, and my
son, Frank Merton, then a boy in his early
teens, with me, in the hope that the trip would
prove beneficial to the wife and mother. The
experiment was in no way disappointing,
although on one occasion when the rain
had poured incessantly, leaving the woods
drenched, in crossing a rather blind and unavoidable
portage, Mrs. Warren's clothing
became thoroughly wet. In the absence of a
wardrobe from which to choose a change of
garments, the expedient was resorted to of
requesting her to remove one garment at a
time, which Vincent De Foe, a half-breed, and
James O'Neill, an old and trusty friend, held
to the open fire, until it was dry. This she
replaced, when another wet garment went
through the same process, until all had been
dried. No ill effects followed; on the contrary,
Mrs. Warren's health continued to improve.</p>

<p>At the end of the trip I was so happy over
the results that I sent the following account
of some of its incidents to Dr. Albert Shaw,
then of the Minneapolis Tribune, and at present,
editor of the Review of Reviews. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
little account appeared in the Tribune of Saturday,
September 6, 1890:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">
"IN THE WILDS OF MINNESOTA.<br />
<br />
Mrs. G. H. Warren's Travels in the Northeastern Part of the State.<br />
</div>

<p>Mrs. G. H. Warren and her son Frank returned
to the city Monday from a two weeks'
tour of the Vermilion Iron Range, north of
Lake Superior. Their trip was both interesting
and novel. From Ely, the eastern
terminus of the Duluth &amp; Iron Range Railroad,
they embarked in birch canoes, traversing ten
lakes, thirteen portages and three small rivers
as far as they were navigable for birch canoes.
The whole distance thus traveled included over
one hundred miles. Pike, pickerel, bass, white
fish, or landlocked salmon abound in all these
lakes of rugged shores. Master Frank reports
the capture of a twenty-seven inch pike and a
thirty-seven inch pickerel. In one of the bays
of Basswood Lake&mdash;a beautiful body of clear
water thirty miles in length and extending
several miles into Canada&mdash;the Indians were
seen gathering wild rice. This is accomplished
by the male Indian standing upright in the bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of his canoe, and paddling it forward through
the field of rice, the stalks of which grow from
three to four feet above the water; while his
squaw sits in the stern of the canoe, and with
two round sticks about the size, and half the
length of a broom handle, dexterously bends
the long heads of the rice over the gunwale
of the canoe with one stick, while at the same
instant, she strikes the well filled heads a sharp,
quick blow with the other, threshing out the
kernels of rice, which fall into the middle portion
of the canoe. This middle portion is provided,
for the occasion, with a cloth apron,
into which the rice kernels fall. The apron
will hold about two bushels, and is filled in the
manner above described in less than three
hours' time. The rice is next picked over to
free it from chaff and straw, after which it is
placed in brass kettles and parched over a slow
fire; then it is winnowed, and is ready for future
use.</p>

<p>Mrs. Warren is the first white woman to
penetrate so far on the frontier of wild Northeastern
Minnesota, and though never before
subjected to uncivilized life, or the primitive
mode of travel, she endured the walks over the
portages, slept soundly on beds of balsam fir
boughs, ate with a relish the excellent fish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wild game cooked at the camp fire, and returns
to her home in the city with health much improved,
and enthusiastic over the many beauties
of nature in this yet wild, but attractive
portion of Minnesota."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Forest Fires.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="98" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">The terrible forest fires that swept
over much of Wisconsin and Minnesota
during the summer of 1894, resulting
in such an appalling loss of
life at Hinckley and vicinity, will always be
remembered by the people living in the northern
half of Minnesota.</p>

<p>One who has never been in the forest at a
time when the fires within it extended over
many miles of area, cannot appreciate the
danger and the anxiety of those who are thus
placed. I vividly recall two days during the
summer of the Peshtigo fire, when I was in
the burning woods of Wisconsin. The sun
was either entirely obscured, or it hung like
a red ball above the earth, now penetrating
the clouds of smoke, now again being hidden
by them. The smoke came at times in great
rolls at the surface of the earth, then was
caught up by the breeze and lifted to higher
altitudes, and at all times was bewildering to
those whom it surrounded.</p>

<p>No one could tell from what point of the
compass the distant fire was most dangerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
nor in what direction it was making most rapid
progress toward the point where he was located.
At times one became choked by the
thick smoke. For many hours, during one of
these days, I moved with my face close to the
ground, that I might get air sufficient to
breathe. When finally I came to an open
country where the currents of wind could lift
the smoke, I experienced a feeling of the greatest
thankfulness that I was delivered from the
condition of the two last days, surrounded with
so much uncertainty as to my safety.</p>

<p>The memorable fire of September 1st, 1894,
which swept Hinckley and all its surrounding
country, resulted in the death of four hundred
and seventeen human beings, left destitute two
thousand two hundred, and extended over an
area of four hundred square miles. The financial
loss was upwards of one million dollars.</p>

<p>That loss does not include the great losses
of timber situated in the northeastern part of
Minnesota, extending all along its boundary
and reaching into Canada. The fire in northeastern
Minnesota destroyed millions of dollars
worth of standing pine timber, much of
which was entirely consumed, while portions
of it were killed at the root. Such timber as
was thus killed, but not destroyed, had most
of its value yet remaining, provided that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
were cut and put in the water, during the first
one or two seasons following. Later than that,
most of its value would have been destroyed
by worms boring into the dead timber. On
account of these fires, it was necessary for
all timber owners to make a careful examination
of all timber lands within the burnt district.
For this purpose, accompanied by S. D.
Patrick, and E. A. White, timber examiners
to assist in the work, and my son, Frank Merton,
then a senior in the University of Minnesota,
besides packers, I went, in 1897, into
the burnt districts in northeastern Minnesota.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"He camps by the roadside on the shore
of a lake." (Page <a href="#Page_180">180</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>As a result of these forest fires, one of the
worst pests that the frontiersman meets is the
black fly, which flourishes in a burnt country.
This little insect is apparently always hungry,
is never tired, and wages a relentless fight upon
every inch of the white man's epidermis that
is exposed to its reach, even penetrating the
hair and beard of a man, and leaving the effects
of its poisonous bite. So terrible were these
little pests, and so numerous were they on two
days of the excursion, that one eye of each of
three of the white men in the party was so
badly swollen by the bites of the insects, that
it was closed. No remedy has ever been offered
that effectually protects the woodsman from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
injuries inflicted by this insect.</p>

<p>While our party was on that expedition that
summer, reestimating the timber in the burnt
district, Mr. Patrick came close to a large bull
moose standing in some thick woods. The
animal had not yet discovered Mr. Patrick's
presence, consequently he was able to carefully
examine and study this great beast of our
northern woods. Below the animal's hips, on
either side, at a point where he could in no wise
protect himself from the ravages of this insect
pest, the poor beast's flesh was raw and was
bleeding. The Indians claim that their dogs
frequently go mad and have to be killed as
a result of the bites inflicted by these insects.</p>

<p>In proof of the wide range of their activities
I will briefly relate one experience with them
in Wisconsin. Joseph McEwen and I left
Wausau one morning, riding out behind a
livery team twenty miles to the Big Eau Plaine
River, in search of desirable cranberry marsh
lands. The country we traveled over was flat.
Fires had recently killed the timber, and black
flies formed one vast colony over this territory.</p>

<p>Our driver had trouble controlling the horses,
so fierce was the attack of the black flies upon
them. We arrived at the nearest point of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
work that could be reached by team about ten
o'clock in the forenoon, and dismissed our
driver. We then proceeded on foot into this
burnt, marshy country, attacked continuously
by swarms of flies. They penetrated our ears,
our noses, and our mouths if we opened them.
They worked themselves into our hair, up our
sleeves, under our collar bands, over the tops
of our socks and down into them until they
found the end of our drawers where, next, was
our naked skin.</p>

<p>We camped at night in the marsh. The next
morning the attack was renewed as vigorously
as it had been waged on the previous day. At
eleven o'clock we stopped for our dinner.
McEwen wore a heavy beard all over his face;
my face was bare. He looked at me as we
were eating our dinner, then dryly remarked,
"I don't know how I look, but you look like
the devil; the black flies have bitten you everywhere;
your face is a fright." We went out to
the main road, and secured a conveyance by
which we reached Wausau about five o'clock
that afternoon.</p>

<p>I went immediately to my accustomed hotel,
owned and managed by Charles Winkley. He
had known me well for years, and I had left
him less than forty-eight hours previous to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
entering on that afternoon. Mr. Winkley was
behind his desk. I greeted him and asked him
how business was. He answered me quite
independently that his house was full, and that
he had not a vacant room. I then asked him
if there was any mail for me, giving him my
full name. He looked at me in astonishment,
then exclaimed, "My God! What is the matter
of you?" I said, "Black flies." Then he continued,
"I mistook you for some man with the
small-pox and was planning to notify the authorities
and have you cared for. Go right to
your room and stay there. Mrs. Winkley will
care for you and have your meals brought to
you. I will go to the postoffice every day for
your mail." My face was one blotch of raw
sores. My eyes were nearly closed because of
the poison from the black flies.</p>

<p>The best remedy or preventive we have ever
found against all insect pests of the northern
woods, is smoked bacon rubbed onto the bare
skin in generous quantities. Its presence is
not essentially disagreeable. Objection to its
use is prejudice, since it is no less pleasant than
is the oil of cedar or pennyroyal which are often
prescribed by druggists for the same purpose,
and which are not half as continuous in their
efficacy, because a little perspiration will neutralize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
all of the good effects of the latter named
remedies. Soap and water will remove the
bacon grease when protection from flying insects
is no longer desired.</p>

<p>There are other and more interesting living
things in the northern woods than black flies,
to which statement I am willing to testify. I
had been running some lines one summer, for
the purpose of locating a tote road to some
camps where work was to be prosecuted the
following fall. It was known among the homesteaders,
as well as trappers, that a large bear
lived in that vicinity. On one occasion he had
been caught in a "dead-fall" that had been set
for him, and he had gotten out of it, leaving
only some tufts of his hair.</p>

<p>Alone, and while blazing a line for this proposed
road, one sunny afternoon, I came onto
a table-rock, in a little opening in the woods,
where fifty feet in front of me lay a large pine
tree that had blown down. As some small
brush crackled under my feet, a bear, which
I have ever since believed from descriptions
that had previously been given me, was the
much wanted great bear, stood up in front of
me, close by the fallen tree. Presumably he had
been awakened from an afternoon nap. The
only weapon that I possessed was what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
known as a boy's ax, the size and kind usually
carried by land examiners. I had not sought
this new acquaintance, nor did I at that moment
desire a closer one, but mentally decided, and
that quickly, that the wrong thing to do would
be to make any effort to get to a place of safety.
I therefore decided to stand my ground and to
put up the best fight possible with my small ax,
in case the bear insisted on a closer acquaintance.
Why I should have laughed on such an
occasion as this, I never have known, but the
perfect helplessness of my situation seemed so
ridiculous, that I broke into a loud laugh. I
have often wondered why that bear at that
moment seemed to think that he had seen
enough of the man whom he faced. Certain
it was, that he turned on his hind legs, leaped
over the log, and disappeared, leaving only the
occasional sound of a twig breaking under his
feet. So well pleased was I with the less distinct
notes of the breaking twigs, that I waited
and listened until I could no longer hear any
of the welcome, receding music. The excitement
having subsided, an inspection of the
little ax revealed the fact that the head was
nearly, but not quite off its handle. This incident
has always been sufficient to convince
me that I have no desire to approach nearer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this animal of the northern woods.</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer of 1899, some special work
was required north of Grand Rapids, Minnesota.
Accompanied by my son, Frank Merton,
and a cook named Fred Easthagen, I left Grand
Rapids on a buckboard drawn by two horses
and driven by Dan Gunn, the popular proprietor
of the Pokegama Hotel. Our route was
over a new road where stumps and pitch holes
were plentiful. The team of horses was said
to have been raised on the western plains, and
objected strenuously to being driven over this
stump road. One of the horses balked frequently,
and, when not standing still, insisted
on running. The passengers, except Easthagen,
became tired of this uneven mode of
travel, and preferred to walk, being able to
cover the ground equally as fast as the team.
Easthagen, however, sat tight through it all;
he having come from the far West, refused to
walk when there was a team to pull him.</p>

<p>Our camp was made in a fine grove of pig-iron
Norway, near to which dwelt Mr. and Mrs.
Sandy Owens, settlers upon government land.
From this camp we were able to prosecute our
work for a long period of time. The late summer
and autumn were very dry. Both wolves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and deer abounded in this vicinity, and not far
away ranged many moose. Large lumbering
camps were about ten miles away. Oxen had
been turned loose for the summer, to pasture
in the woods and cut-over lands. Passing, one
day, a root house built into the side of a hill, we
pushed open the door, and in there found the
remains of an ox. The animal had probably
entered the root house to get away from the
flies, and, the door having closed behind him,
he had no means of escape, so that the poor
beast had perished of hunger and thirst. The
ground was dry, and all the brush, and twigs,
and leaves lying thereon, had become brittle
and crackled under the feet of every walking
creature. This interfered much with the ability
of the wolves to surprise the deer, rabbits, or
other animals on which they are accustomed to
feed, so that they were hungry. On this account
they had become emboldened, so much
so, that they would, at nightfall or toward
evening, venture near enough to show themselves.</p>

<p>My son was coming in alone, from work one
evening, when a pack of wolves followed him
for some distance, occasionally snapping out
their short yelp, and had he been less near the
camp, he might have been in great danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
As it was, however, they kept back from him
in the woods, but not so far as to prevent his
hearing them.</p>

<p>An interesting article appeared in one of the
numbers of "Country Life in America," on the
subject of breeding skunks for profit. From
their pelts is made and sold a fine quality of
fur, known, to the purchaser, at least, as stone
martin. The nearest approach to a natural
farm of these animals that I have ever known
was that existing at Sandy Owen's cabin, and
immediately adjacent to it. These little animals
were numerous in the Norway grove in
which we were camped.</p>

<p>My son and I slept in a small "A" tent which
at night was closed. On one occasion I was
awakened by feeling something moving across
my feet on the blankets, covering us. I spoke
quietly to my son, requesting him to be careful
not to move, for something was in the tent,
and probably, that something was a skunk.
With the gentlest of motions, I moved just sufficiently
to let the animal know that I was aware
of its presence in the tent. Immediately the
animal retreated off of my legs, while we remained
quiet for some time in the tent. Then
a match was struck and with it a candle lighted,
when a small hole was discovered at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of the tent where evidently the animal had
nosed its way in, and through which it had
retreated. In the morning when my son and
I arose, unmistakable evidence was discovered,
near where our heads had lain, that his skunkship
had visited us during the night.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Owens left their cabin to visit
another settler, several miles distant, leaving
the key with the cook, and telling him that he
could use it if he had occasion to do so. Coming
in one evening from a cruise, the cook went
to the cabin to make and bake some bread in
Mrs. Owen's stove. A small hole had been
cut in the door, to admit the Owens' cat. On
entering, Easthagen saw a skunk sitting in the
middle of the floor. The animal retreated
under the bed, while the cook kindled a fire
in the stove and began mixing the dough for
the bread. He baked the bread and cooked
the evening meal for three persons, considerately
tossing some bits of bread and meat near
to where the skunk was concealed. Our party
ate supper outside the door a short distance
from the cabin. The animal remained in the
cabin that night and until after breakfast, a
portion of which latter the cook fed to it, when
taking the broom, he, by easy and gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
stages, pushed the skunk toward the door, removing
the animal without accident.</p>

<p>The state of Minnesota has some excellent
laws to prevent the destruction of game animals
by the pothunter. Notwithstanding this
fact, a greater or less number of market hunters
have been able to subsist by killing unlawful
game and selling the meat to the lumber camps
at about five cents per pound. Many men interested
in the ownership of timber lands, have
been aware of this fact and have been desirous
of preventing the unlawful killing of moose and
deer. Some lumbermen, also, have refused to
buy the meat from these market hunters. It
has not been safe, however, for such people
to offer evidence against these hunters. There
have been two principal reasons that have
deterred them from so doing. One is, that
the informant's personal safety would have
become endangered, and the other reason is,
that his timber would have been in danger of
being set on fire. It rests, therefore, with the
game wardens, to ferret out and prosecute to
the best of their ability, all offenders against
the game law.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the season of 1905, my
son and I, accompanied by James O'Neill, a
frontiersman and trusty employee, made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
canoe trip from Winton down the chain of
lakes on the boundary line between Minnesota
and Canada, as far as Lake La Croix. We
camped at night and traveled by day, being
always in Minnesota. We saw racks in Minnesota
made by the Indians, on which to smoke
the meat of the moose they had killed. We
counted twenty-one moose hides hung up to
dry. The moose had doubtless been killed as
they came to the lakes to get away from flies
and mosquitoes. All these animals were unlawfully
killed.</p>

<p>A more pleasant sight than the one just related
was once accorded us while working in
this same country. We were quietly pushing
our canoes up a sluggish stream that had found
its bed in a spruce swamp. There, in many
places, pond lilies were growing, their wide
leaves resting on the surface of the water.
The roots of the lilies are much relished as a
food by the moose. We have seen the moose
standing out in the bays of the lakes, and in
the almost currentless streams, where the
water was up to the animal's flanks, or where
its body was half immersed, and poking its
head deep below the surface in search of the
succulent roots of the lilies. On this day, a
mother moose and her twin calves had come
to this stream to feed. She was in the act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
reaching down under the water for a lily root,
as we pushed our canoes quietly over the surface
of the water into her very presence. The
first to observe us was one of the young calves
not more than two days old, that rose to its
feet, close by on the shore. The mother looked
toward her calf before she saw us; then, without
undue haste, waded ashore. At this moment
the second calf arose, shook itself, then,
with the other twin, joined its mother. The
three moved off into the spruce swamp as we
sat quietly in our canoes, enjoying to the fullest
this most unusual opportunity of the experienced
woodsman, accustomed as he is to
surprises. Our only regret on this occasion
was, that we had no camera with us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>White Pine&mdash;What of Our
Future Supply?</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">It is claimed that where Dartmouth
College is, in the town of Hanover,
New Hampshire, on the bank of the
Connecticut River, there once stood
a white pine tree two hundred and seventy
feet in height. That is said to have been the
tallest white pine of which there is a record.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-seven species of pine that grow
in the United States, the white pine is the best.
Nature was lavish in distributing this beautiful
and useful tree on American soil, for it
has been found growing in twenty-four states
of the Union.</p>

<p>The following quotation is from Bulletin 99
of the Forest Service of the United States:</p>

<p>"White pine occurred originally in commercial
quantities in Connecticut, Delaware,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cut has probably exceeded that of any other
species. Several timber trees have a wider
commercial range, and at the present time two
yield more lumber yearly&mdash;Douglas fir and
longleaf pine&mdash;but white pine was the leader
in the market for two hundred and fifty years.
Though to-day the original forests of this
species are mere fragments of what they once
were, the second growth in small regions is
meeting heavy demand. In Massachusetts,
for example, the cut in 1908 was two hundred
and thirty-eight million feet, and practically
all of it was second growth. It is not improbable
that a similar cut can be made every year
in the future from the natural growth of white
pine in that state. It might be shown by a
simple calculation that if one-tenth of the original
white pine region were kept in well-protected
second growth, like that in Massachusetts,
it would yield annual crops, successfully
for all time, as large as the white pine
cut in the United States in 1908. To do this
would require the growth of only twenty-five
cubic feet of wood per acre each year, and good
white pine growth will easily double that
amount. The supply of white pine lumber
need never fail in this country, provided a moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
area is kept producing as a result of
proper care.</p>

<p>"During the past thirty years the largest cut
of white pine has come from the Lake States,
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota."</p>

<p>It is shown in the government's reports that
forty-eight per cent of the total lumber output
of the United States in 1908 was pine. If
something near this ratio is to be maintained,
it must be by planting and growing the trees.
Under the present system of taxation, neither
individuals nor corporations will undertake the
work. The investment, at the shortest, is one
of thirty years before returns may be looked
for, while twice that time is better business.
Owners of pine forests are obliged now, and
have been in past years, to cut their timber
lands clean because of excessive taxation. To
encourage the planting and cultivation of new
pine forests, it would be better to levy no tax
upon the individual's or corporation's young
trees until the time that the timber has grown
to a size fit to be marketed, and then only on
that portion which is cut into lumber. Even
with this encouragement it is an enterprise that
belongs largely to the state, and from it must
emanate the aggressive movement upon land
belonging to the state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>On the subject of "Reforestation with White
Pine," Prof. E. G. Cheyney, Director of the
College of Forestry in the University of Minnesota,
states: "Like everything else, a tree
does better on good soil, but the pine tree has
the faculty of growing well on soil too poor
for any other crop.... On the best
quality of soil the white pine tree has produced
100 M feet per acre in Europe. On the third
quality soil it makes from 40 to 60 M feet. Our
forest soils are, on the whole, of better quality
than those devoted to forests in Europe.</p>

<p>"The Forest Experiment Station at Cloquet,
under the control of the College of Forestry,
is now studying this reforestation policy, and
the State Forest Service is looking after the
forest fires and expects to begin the reforestation
of our State Forests this spring.</p>

<p>"There are now two National Forests in
Minnesota aggregating about 1,300,000 acres
and only 50,000 acres of State Forest. These
State Forests should be increased to at least
3,000,000 acres."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Retrospect&mdash;Meed of Praise.</b></big></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="" />
</div><p class="drop-cap">It is hoped that the foregoing pages
have thrown some light upon the
peculiar occupation of the pioneer
woodsman as he is related to lumbering
in the Northwest. There has been no attempt
to do more than to give a plain recital
of some of the events that have occurred in the
experiences of one man while pioneering in
this special field of the great timber and lumbering
industry of the Northwest. Another,
engaged in the same pursuit, might easily relate
his personal experiences of equal or greater
scope than have been herein portrayed, for
not all has been said that might be of the
woodsman's secluded life.</p>

<p>The occupation of this type of man is fast
being eliminated, and soon his place will be
known no more. In fact, the time has already
arrived when there is no longer any primeval
forest in the Northwest into which he may
enter and separate himself from others of his
own race. Railroads have been built in many
directions into these vast forests, and the fine,
stately pine trees have been cut down and sent
out over the lines of these railroads. Men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and their families have come from various
states and from foreign countries, and are still
coming to make for themselves homes on the
lands now denuded of their once majestic forest
trees towering high, and overshadowing
all the earth beneath with their green branches
and waving plumage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"Prepare their fish just caught for the meal,
by the open camp fire." (Page <a href="#Page_180">180</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>The neigh of the horse, the low of the cow
or the ox, and the laugh or song of the child
is now heard where twenty years ago in summer
time, stalked fearlessly the moose and the
deer, where roamed the bear at will, unmolested,
safe from the crack of the white
man's rifle.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse springs into existence,
where a year ago were stumps and trees. The
faithful teacher, fresh from one of the normal
schools or colleges of the state, comes into
the settlement to train the minds and to help
mould the characters of the future farmers,
mechanics, statesmen, or financiers; of the
doctors, lawyers, judges; or honored wives
and mothers. From this ever increasing supply
of the newly-born Northwest, are coming
and will continue to come, some of the most
valued accretions of good citizens to the commonwealth
of Minnesota.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Farms are yielding their first crops to the
sturdy husbandman. Pleasant, comfortable
homes meet the eye of the tourist from the city
in summer as he motors over the fairly good
roads of the northern frontier. He enters
little towns carved out of the woods, and finds,
now living happily, friends whom he had known
in the city, who are ready to welcome him.
He camps by the roadside on the shore of a
lake, or on the bank of the Mississippi whose
waters flowed on unobstructed in the earlier
days herein recorded, but now are harnessed
for the better service of man. Here he brings
his family and friends to fish and to lunch, or,
better still, to prepare their fish just caught for
the meal, by the open camp fire. He continues
his journey through this unbroken wilderness
of less than a generation ago, over improving
roads, to the very source of the Mississippi
River that is within five minutes' walk of Lake
Itasca. Here is a refreshing bit of natural pine
forest, owned and preserved by the state of
Minnesota, where he and his friends may find
shelter for the night, and for a longer period if
desired.</p>

<p>In concluding this subject, I am actuated by
a desire to manifest my appreciation of the fine
manhood possessed by many men whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
known, the best part of whose lives has been
spent similarly to my own, in the extensive
forests that once beautified and adorned the
great Northwest.</p>

<p>The occupation is one which demands many
of the highest attributes of man. He must be
skillful enough as a surveyor to always know
which description of land he is on, and where
he is on that description. He must be a good
judge of timber, able to discern the difference
between a sound tree and a defective one, as
well as to estimate closely the quantity and
quality of lumber, reckoned in feet, board
measure, each tree will likely produce when
sawed at the mill. He must examine the contour
of the country where the timber is, and
make calculations how the timber is to be
gotten out, either by water or by rail, and
estimate how much money per thousand feet
it will cost, to bring the logs to market. The
value of the standing pine or other timber in
the woods is dependent on all of these conditions,
which must be reckoned in arriving at
an estimate of the desirability of each tract of
timber as an investment for himself, or for
whomsoever he may represent.</p>

<p>Possessing these qualifications, he must also
be honest; he must be industrious; he must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
courageous. He must gain the other side of
rivers that have no bridges over them, and he
must cross lakes on which there are no boats.
He must find shelter when he has no tent, and
make moccasins when his shoes are worn and
no longer of service, and new ones are not to
be obtained; he must be indefatigable, for he
will often be tempted to leave some work half
finished rather than overcome the physical obstacles
that lay between him and the completion
of his task.</p>

<p>On the character of this man and on his
faithfulness, his honesty, his conscientiousness,
and on the correctness of his knowledge concerning
the quality, quantity, and situation as
to marketing the timber he examines, depends
the value of the investments. Hundreds of
thousands of dollars are invested on the word
of this man, after he has disappeared into the
wilderness and emerged with his report of
what he has seen. The requisitions of manhood
for this work are of a very high degree,
and, when such a man is found, he is entitled
to all of the esteem that is ever accorded to an
honest, faithful, conscientious cashier, banker,
or administrator of a large estate.</p>

<p>Is he required to furnish an illustrious example
to prove the worthiness of his chosen
occupation, let him cite to the inquirer the
early manhood days of George Washington,
who penetrated the forests from his home in
Virginia, traveling through a country where
savages roamed, pushing his course westward
to the Ohio River in his search for valuable
tracts of land for investment, and surveying
lands for others than himself.</p>

<p>His occupation is an honorable one, and
those who pursue it with an honest purpose,
are accorded a high place in the esteem of
those whom they serve, and with whom they
associate.</p>
